<div class="entry-content"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/5513063?portrait=0" width="600" height="337" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The beginning of the semester has me thinking about
<a href="http://vimeo.com/5513063">this 30 minute video</a> I saw about a year ago
on teaching and schools by <a href="http://drtae.org">Dr. Tae</a>.  It’s
provocative and if you care about teaching, especially at the university
level, I encourage you to watch it.  I agree with most of what he’s
saying and try to incorporate a lot of his ideas in my own classes.  But
he’s just wrong about a few things.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae is unhappy with the state of schools in America–he says
they “suck” for a variety of reasons, but the main one is that they are
full of big impersonal lecture classes where the teacher/professor
stands at the front and pontificates while the students sit there
and take notes (best case) or update their Facebook status (worst case).</p>

<p>I don’t think lecture classes have to be all that bad–I had some very
good ones when I was an undergrad science major at
<a href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer</a> in the mid 1980’s.  At the time (and maybe
still) the institution took a lot of pride in it’s teaching.  Big physics
and chemistry lectures were full of very entertaining and illuminating
experiments and I definitely learned in that environment.  The
main problem with this set up is that it isn’t optimal–there are much
better ways to teach when the professor and students are in close
proximity.  I actually think the days of the big lecture are numbered as
there are several places people can go to get free high quality
impersonal video lectures on the internet.  You may have heard of
<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a>,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/">iTunes U</a>, and
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT’s Open Courseware</a>.  I was very happy
to see one of Yale’s very best economics professors on the front page of
<a href="http://www.academicearth.org/">Academic Earth</a> earlier this week.
<a href="http://www.academicearth.org/courses/game-theory">Ben Polak’s game theory class</a>
is legendary here, and now anyone on earth can experience it (as a
non-interactive lecture) for free.  The point is that if you’re paying
gobs of money for an in-person university education, you deserve better
than that.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae goes on to say that university teaching is bad because schools
don’t hire great teachers–they hire and promote based on research. He’s
exactly right about this.  Not only is teaching ability ignored
during hiring, all the incentives for tenure track faculty are to spend
as little time as possible on teaching.  You just have to keep your
enrollments and student evaluations above pretty low thresholds.  I
don’t see how universities can improve without changing these hiring
practices and incentives.</p>

<p>As an aside, he’s pretty critical of the certification process that’s
required for getting most secondary school jobs.  In order to teach
science at the high school level, I think you should not only know a lot
about science, you should also know how to teach.  The certification
process (flawed as it is) is supposed to make sure you do.  I bet
Dr. Tae would be an amazing high school science teacher, but I’m not so
sure about all of his Northwestern physics faculty colleagues.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae hates grades; he calls them “coercive”–he feels that teachers
make students think the way they want them to think by holding grades
over their head.  I’ll concede that there are better ways to motivate
students to work hard than grades, but at the end of the day, the grade
is how someone who wasn’t in the classroom (like a prospective employer
or admissions committee) can judge what you learned in that classroom.
It provides information that’s just not readily apparent in an
interview.  So I’m not ready to just throw out grades all together.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae loves for kids (even adult kids) to ask questions and do
experiments to answer them.  I agree this is a great way to learn and
stay excited about science.  It’s also true that having a strong base of
knowledge (be that facts or methods) is important and that means
students have to read and listen to stuff they might think is boring in
the moment.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae is exactly right when he says the secret to learning is to “Work
your ass off until you figure it out”.  Failure is far more common than
success in science and learning.  So often I have students who come to
me and say “I read the article for today and didn’t understand it.
Something is terribly wrong!”  No it’s not.  Learning is hard.  Reading
science, doing math, writing well, making an argument, they all take
serious effort.  None of it is supposed to be like reading a newspaper
article or watching tv.  It’s totally normal to have to read something
several times to get it.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae talks a bunch about how fundamentally broken our schools are
with their bad teachers and semester-long courses and grades.  But then
he says there are a lot of ways we can “polish the turd”.  He’s right about
this too.  My students ask their own questions, work in small groups,
and spend big chunks of time one-on-one with me.  I reward curiosity,
creativity, and hard work in my grading.  Many of them continue research
they started in my classes after the semester is over.  My bet is that
all this is true of Dr. Tae’s classes when he teaches physics.</p>

<p>Before you throw out schools as currently conceived, you have to be
ready to replace them with something better.  Here’s where I think
Dr. Tae’s train goes off the rails.  His ideas about “distributed
teaching” are totally crazy.  He seems to think that we should all teach
what we know part-time and all together, this will give people a better
educational experience than they would get in college.  He gives
Wikipedia as an example.  I love Wikipedia, but reading about a topic
there is a far cry from taking a course on it with someone who has spent
their life studying it.</p>

<p>Like so many things, it all comes down to incentives.  Knowledge is a
public good, but someone has to produce it and communicate it.  That’s
not free.  A system that depends on people volunteering their time is a
system that produces an extremely sub-optimal amount of knowledge.
There’s probably a role for government in subsidizing this production,
and I think this a great argument for not
<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/21271">dismantling our public universities</a>.
But I do think there’s vast room for improvement to the education
system.  In the meantime I’ll continue to polish turds in my own
classes.</p>
