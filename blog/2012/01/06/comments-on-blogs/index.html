<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s become very trendy on tech blogs to not allow comments on articles.
And at least a couple of folks
(<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">Matt Gemmell</a> and
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/11/gemmell-comments/">Ben Brooks</a> have been
actively trying to convince other bloggers to turn off their comments too.  I
agree that if you&#8217;ve got a popular blog (and maybe a thin skin), turning
off comments can make your life easier.  I would even agree that on
popular blogs (and websites more generally) many (most?)  comments don&#8217;t
really further the discussion.  In fact, I read most of my blogs
(including Matt&#8217;s and Ben&#8217;s) inside
<a href="http://reederapp.com/">an RSS reader</a> and so I don&#8217;t even see any of
the comments that might or might not be there unless I click through to
the site itself.</p>

<p>But I have three objections to their position on comments.  First, when
you don&#8217;t get much traffic (I&#8217;m looking at you High Variance) and you
know most of the people reading your blog, it&#8217;s really nice to get as
much feedback as possible and I think comments are the best way to do
that.  If someone reading my article has something interesting to say
about it, the comment gives them an audience.  They can always email if
they want to say something privately,</p>

<p>Second, I often like to read what other people have to say about an
article (whether I&#8217;ve written it or not), even when I have to wade
through some less than insightful stuff.  Again, the signal-to-noise
ratio is particularly high in the early days of a blog when it&#8217;s mostly
friends reading, but even on a big messy site like
<a href="http://www.espn.com">espn.com</a> I think it&#8217;s fun to see the popular
reaction to a story.  And yes, I get it that the sample is not even
representative of the readership let alone the general population.  I
think <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is a terrific example of how
constructive (and entertaining) discussion of an issue can happen on the
web through comments.</p>

<p>Third, there&#8217;s this high horse attitude that if people have something to
say about an article, they should just write it up as an article on
their own blog.  And if the original author reads it and wants to
comment back, they will write another article on their blog.  I&#8217;m sorry,
but this just doesn&#8217;t happen.  I mean, I&#8217;ve seen blogs comment on other
blogs, but in almost every case the debate stops there.  And it&#8217;s
impossible for someone visiting the original site to see the
conversation at all.  And, believe it or not, there are people with
intelligent things to say that don&#8217;t have a blog.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll change my tune in the future when I&#8217;m drowning in haters and
forum-spam, but I have a feeling that&#8217;s going to be a while.  Until
then, comments will stay turned on.</p>
