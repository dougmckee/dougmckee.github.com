<div class="entry-content"><p>Every year or so I get cranky about my task management system and switch
to something new.  This year it’s particularly bad because I’ve been
hearing the Siren Song of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.  I swear every nerd blogger I read
uses it: e.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/08/omnifocus-v-things-mac-ipad-iphone/">The Brooks Review</a></li>
  <li>David Sparks at <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/7/30/ipad-omnifocus-review.html">MacSparky</a></li>
  <li>Aleh Cherp at <a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2012/04/02/task-management-with-omnifocus-collecting-and-processing/">Macademic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I even believe John Gruber (<a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>) uses it though he’s a
little cagy since they are often a sponsor of his.</p>

<p>BUT, I strongly believe you shouldn’t switch systems unless you’re
solving specific problems.  That is, I invest in my systems and don’t
want to switch just for fun.  Hearing that some other piece of software
is “really good” or even “better” than what you’re currently using
isn’t good enough for me.</p>

<p>Last year when I made the switch from <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a> to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>
(RTM), I had some clear requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cross-platform</em>: I was spending time on Mac, Windows, iPad, and
 iPhone and I needed to be able to access my tasks from all of them.</li>
  <li><em>Rock solid invisible sync</em>: I never wanted to think about which
 version of my task list I was working with.  There should be just one
 master copy (preferably in the cloud) that gets seemlessly accessed
 and updated from various clients.</li>
  <li><em>Power and flexibility</em>: Google Tasks met the first two criteria, but it was just too
 simple.  I wanted more than due dates and separate lists.  I wanted
 to be able to attach priorities, contexts, durations, and other
 arbitrary tags.  I wanted to  dynamically create lists based on
 these characteristics that showed me just what I wanted (and was
 able) to do at any particular moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time, RTM was the best solution, but the world has changed since
then.  Omnifocus now provides highly regarded Sync Services.  And I’ve
shed my need for Windows now that I carry a MacBook Air with me
everywhere i go.</p>

<p>Stepping up a level for a moment, the overall task management system you
use is far more important than the particular tool you use to implement
it.  I’m a GTD (Getting Things Done) guy, though I’m not the most
orthodox devotee you’ll meet.  There are two things I love about GTD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You get the mental to do list out of your head.  Since you’re not
constantly worrying that you’ll forget something, your mind is freed up
for more interesting creative work.  And you’re not forgetting things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once your tasks are organized, GTD provides a way to quickly see what
you can and should be doing in any given context.  This is exactly what
I couldn’t do with Google Tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After a year of experience (and tweeking), I’ve got an implementation of
my GTD system in Remember The Milk that works pretty well.  Before
casting it aside for a new pretty young thing, I’m going to describe my
system and what works and doesn’t work for me.  It’s almost certainly
not a perfect match for anyone else, but it might give you ideas for
things to try or think about.  </p>

<p>RTM is a simple system that lets you build complex systems on top of it.
Basically, you just define a bunch of lists of tasks with
characteristics.  These characteristics include priorities, due dates,
durations, locations, and arbitrary tags–exactly what I want.  The
power comes from defining Smart Lists that are basically saved searches
based on these characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Even though RTM supports multiple lists, I keep almost all my tasks in
the Inbox list and use other lists only for storing things like books
I’d like to read or ideas for upcoming posts.  I define my projects with
tags.  Home-related projects have tags starting with “ph-“ (e.g.,
“ph-basement”) and work-related projects have tags starting with “pw-“.
Most tasks that go into the system have either a project assigned or a simple
“work” tag.  If it’s a single task home project, I don’t take the time
to assign a project tag at all.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>I assign each task a single location tag: at-desk, at-phone, at-home,
at-econoffice, at-errand, or at-wife.  The last one is special: tasks
that require consultation with my wife.  Someone else that runs a lot of
errands might find it worth their time to set up several locations that
cause tasks to pop up when they go somewhere, but generally I go
somewhere <em>because</em> I need to do something and so don’t need to get
reminded.</p>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p>Coming up with the right set of contexts is critical to the system and
it’s the hardest part. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">The GTD Book</a>, David Allen talks a lot about home,
office, and phone. With smart phones, the set of things you can do “on
the phone” is far larger than it used to be.  Since I usually have my
laptop with me and most of my resources are online, home office,
work office, and even cafe are almost the same.</p>

<p>Right now I have four smart lists that define my contexts:</p>

<p><strong>c-working</strong> </p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (list:Inbox and (tagContains:pw- or
tag:work or tag:weekday) and (dueWithin:"5 days of today" or
priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the context I look at during the work day or at night when
I’m working.  It includes everything due today or that’s overdue so I
don’t miss deadlines.  It also includes any tasks associated with
work-related projects or that can only be done during the week
(<tt>tag:weekday</tt>).  The most interesting piece is where I drop all
tasks that are due more than five days from now that have no priority
assigned.  These are the tasks I don’t even want to think about until it
gets closer to their due date.</p>

<p><strong>c-weekend</strong></p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (not tag:work and not
tagContains:pw- and not tag:weekday and list:Inbox and (dueWithin:"5
days of today" or priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On weekends and any time I want to focus on the non-work part of my
life I check this list.  It’s almost the inverse of my work context
except that it also includes anything that’s due or past due.</p>

<p><strong>c-out</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:at-errand or tag:at-phone
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I should and can do when I’m out and about.</p>

<p><strong>c-easy</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:fun or tag:easy or timeEstimate:"&lt; 1 hour"
</code></pre>

<p>When I’m tired or just have a few minutes, I look at this list.  It’s my
newest context, and I might eventually break it into a tired list and a
separate quick-task list.  </p>

<p>All four of these Smart Lists are sorted first by due date and then by
priority.  I often use <strong>high priority</strong> to mark that a task is the
next action for a project.  This way it’s always listed before other
actions that I want to record but might not be ready to do.  A while
back I read <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">another article</a> about implementing GTD in RTM and it
suggested using an <strong>na</strong> tag.  My system allows me to complete a task
for a project and have the other tasks still show up on the list.  The
last thing I want to do is to constantly be tagging new tasks as <strong>na</strong>
as I complete other tasks.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when I want to focus on a particular project
and in those cases I simply look at the Tag view for the project and
see all the tasks associated with the project no matter when they are
due or what their priority.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly Review:</h2>

<p>Just as David Allen says, I’ve found that if I don’t do a weekly review,
the information in the system drifts away from the information in my
brain and loses its value.  That’s when most folks fall off the wagon.
So support for the weekly review process is super-important.  Here’s
what I do every week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at my untagged Smart List (<tt>not isTagged:true list:Inbox</tt>)
and assign project (if necessary) or location tags</li>
  <li>Look at the tasks for each project:
    <ul>
      <li>Are any upcoming tasks missing?  </li>
      <li>Are priorities and due dates right?</li>
      <li>Can I delete any tasks that are no longer needed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any new projects that didn’t make it into the system during the week</li>
  <li>Quickly look at all the tasks in the system (usually between 100 and 150)
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need to lower / raise any priorities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look at what I accomplished in last week (<tt>completedWithin:”1 week
of today”</tt>)–good for setting feasible future expectations </li>
</ul>

<p>One nice thing about this way of doing weekly reviews is that it can be
done in chunks here and there –I don’t have to set aside the
traditional 2-3 hour block.</p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>

<p>On the whole, I’m pretty happy with my system, but that doesn’t mean
there’s not lots of room for improvement.  </p>

<p>First, my system isn’t that great for capturing or doing long range
planning.  I can’t specify task dependencies and I can’t even specify
start dates for tasks.  If I could, that would let me filter out tasks
that I know I’m not starting for a while.  I try to follow orthodox GTD
practice and only use due dates for when things are really due. That way
I don’t miss these things in a sea of stuff that I’d like to be done on
that day.</p>

<p>Second, while the iOS apps are very good, I’m getting tired of the
clunky RTM web interface.  It’s functional, but pretty ugly.   I use
Fluid to make RTM a pop down menubar app, but I can’t get it to play
well with multiple Spaces.  That is, when I pop down the app, it pulls
me back to the Space I first started it.  And when RTM automatically
logs me out of the website (more often than I’d like), 
<a href="http://support.agilebits.com/discussions/1password-38-for-mac-from-agilebits-website/11718-1password-with-fluid">I can’t use 1Password to log back bin</a>.  I’m still totally dumbfounded that
no one has built a decent native Mac app for the service.</p>

<p>Third, entering new tasks requires me to click on the menubar app and
then put the cursor in the new task text entry box.  It sure would be
nice to have a global hot key for this.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Remember The Milk bugs me, but it also works for me.  And maybe
Omnifocus wouldn’t be uniformly better.  I’m worried that it would
try to force me into new ways of doing things that just don’t match my
work flow.  Maybe instead I need to check out <a href="http://donaldjenkins.com/2012/02/why-i-switched-from-omnifocus-to-things/">Things</a>….  Or maybe I
just need to get back to work!</p>
