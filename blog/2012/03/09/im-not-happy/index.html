<div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard that Apple announced a new iPad this week and that
they released a version of iPhoto that runs on iPads and iPhones. Most
folks seem to
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/07/iphoto-for-ios">like it quite a bit</a>,
while a few people have complained that it’s
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/iphoto-confusion/">unintuitive</a> with
all its mysterious icons and gestures.  The problems with Apple’s
“system” for managing and editing photos go much deeper and I find it
incredibly frustrating because Apple has all the pieces for something
truly fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Crappy About the Current System:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The new iPhoto doesn’t run on the original iPad. I get it that I’m in
the minority of people who like to buy a product and run into into the
ground before upgrading.  And I get it that it that some of the filters
might be a little slow.  But Adobe Photoshop Express runs well.  I think
their public reasoning is that the experience on my iPad would be
sub-par.  And it conveniently gives me another reason to upgrade.
Fine.  I’ll give Apple a pass on this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are Photos and iPhoto separate apps?  I would understand if
iPhoto had a superset of Photos’ features, but it doesn’t.  Photos
allows me to move photos between albums, create new albums, and do some
minor editing.  iPhoto has more powerful editing tools and lets me share
photos with friends in different ways, but it doesn’t manage albums.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any album management you do with Photos doesn’t get sync’ed back to
the desktop version of iPhoto.  So why would I possibly go to the
trouble of organizing my photos on the phone itself?  I would say this
was a bug, but it’s been there since iOS 5 was released in October.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photo Stream is a feature that doesn’t fit into my work flow.  I can
easily access all the photos I’ve taken over the last 30 days on any of
my devices.  If I want a photo that I took earlier than that, I must
have moved it someplace more permanent during that 30 day window or I
have to go back to the device where I took the picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t easily share photos between my Mac and my wife’s PC.  While
Apple might think this increases the chance that she will upgrade to a
Mac one of the days, this sort of thing just makes her dig her feet in
and resent the “Apple’s walled garden” even more than she already does.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Would Be a Lot Better:</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.  My perfect world looks more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto stores all my photos (and albums and events) in iCloud and
replicates them on my Mac.  Besides giving me a central repository that
I can access from anywhere, it’s also my off-site backup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto gets merged with the Photos app and it also accesses my photos
in iCloud.  This means any organization I do (e.g., moving photos
between albums) happens in one place: iCloud.  It also means that I
don’t have to actually store all the photos (and home video clips) on
the device itself—it can stream them as needed and manage a cache of
them so it seems fast.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apple provides a web app for browsing and organizing photos that
could be used from a PC.  Even better, they would open up the iCloud API
so someone could write a version of iPhoto for the PC that used the same
iCloud photo store, but that seems unlikely to happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photostream gets replaced by something simpler that just dumps all
photos taken by my devices into my iCloud photo store.  If they get
grouped as events (ala desktop iPhoto import) they’ll be easy to find
when I want to organize them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This dream system isn’t easy to build, but it’s not impossible either.
I just hope that Apple isn’t sitting there thinking their current system
is good enough or that it just needs a few minor tweeks.  And I really
hope that some improvements are in the pipeline.  If iOS 6 isn’t a lot
better, I might just have to switch my photo management to Google
Picasa.  And this Apple fan-boi certainly doesn’t want to do that.</p>
