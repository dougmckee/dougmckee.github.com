<time datetime="2012-03-30T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 30<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I love paper—wrapping paper, home made greeting cards, paper mâché
piñatas, a good coffee table book, any <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Wonderful-Wizard-Oz-Commemorative/dp/0689817517">Sabuda pop up book</a>, origami,
even (especially?) paper airplanes—it all makes me happy.  And up until
recently, paper played a big role in my workflow.  I read a lot of
research articles and generally, I would print them and write all over
them.  The act of taking notes forces me to engage and extract much more
than I would if I were passively reading.  These hand-annotated articles
would go into my file cabinet so I could refer to my notes next time I
read the article.  I also grade about 100 student papers per semester
and like to provide copious feedback.  Since my work days are spread
between two or three campus offices and a home office, my <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16921367136/ode-to-my-messenger-bag">bag</a> would
get pretty heavy.</p>

<p>My writing process also involved a fair bit of paper as I would hand
write almost all my first drafts. It just felt more comfortable than
transferring my thoughts directly to a text file via keyboard, even
though it meant eventually typing up those drafts and having a
paper pad in my bag next to my iPad at all times.</p>

<p>Three things have happened that have allowed me to comfortably
transition the bulk of my previously paper-based work to the digital
world: iPad, cloud storage, and my new attitude toward writing. The iPad
lets me bring my research library with me and read it as if I were
reading paper. The screen and software are fast enough that annotation
feels natural, and it’s far easier to read in a variety of positions and
places than a laptop.  The cloud (in particular <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>) lets me
edit or annotate on any of my devices and have the results
automatically synchronized with all my other devices without my lifting
a finger.  I love
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2012/01/tip-for-getting-more-organized.html">technology that works for me rather than vice versa</a>.</p>

<p>My new attitude toward writing has nothing to do with hardware or
software and everything to do with the fact that I’m just writing more.
This includes blogging, writing handouts for classes, writing letters of
recommendation, writing referee reports for journals, and even
occasionally writing up my own research.  I’m getting more comfortable
composing on the computer through simple practice, and the fact that
the bulk of my writing is low-stakes has made the learning curve bearable.</p>

<p>Reading and annotation take place mostly on the iPad in GoodReader.
I’ve yet to see a pdf that it can’t handle and over the past two years
the annotation features have become better and better.  I’m still a
little slower on the iPad than I am scribbling on paper with a red pen,
but the advantages outweigh the current speed penalty. I don’t have to
carry 300 pages of paper around. I don’t have to make photo copies of
anything. I can distribute comments on papers via email as soon as
they’re ready.  Students don’t have to decipher my handwriting.  And
with practice I think I’ll get faster.  There are (several) other pdf
annotation apps for the iPad, but none of them (AFAIK) integrate as well
with Dropbox.  I can specify a folder and GoodReader will download all
the pdf’s in it so I have local copies.  Then, after I’ve made my
changes I just have to press the Sync button and the modified files are
uploaded.</p>

<p>The Preview app on the Mac has always allowed some pdf annotation, but
with the Lion release, it became excellent.  On a desktop monitor (or
two), I can blow up the text nice and big in one window and still have
room to see tables/figures in another.  With a real keyboard and a
healthy dose of keyboard shortcuts, I’m actually pretty fast at marking
up a document.  I’ve heard good things about <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/">Skim</a> as a Preview
replacement, and at some point I’ll give it a try.</p>

<p>For storage and searching, I use Mekentosj’s <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> app.  It integrates
with several online research databases (including ISI’s <a href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com">Web of
Knowledge</a>) and makes it very easy to slurp articles into my own libary.
I’ve also had some success with having it generate bibliographies for my
own papers.  But at the end of day, I spend a lot more time reading and
annotating with Preview or GoodReader that I do searching and organizing
in Papers.</p>

<p>New writing mostly happens on a Mac.  I continue to get faster at typing
on the iPad and iPhone, but I’m still way more efficient with a real
keyboard.  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> (<a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> to be specific) is my
editor-of-choice (as it has been for more than 20 years now) but I’ve
started using <a href="http://www.mindnode.com/">Mindnode</a> for initial brainstorming.  I’m not sure it
will stick, but it is fun.</p>

<p>My work world has a lot less paper in it than it did 6 months ago, but
I’m still not 100% paperless.  What’s left is mostly scraps, but there
are two things that I’d like to eventually transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Old articles:</strong>  I still have that big file cabinet full of articles
with notes.  Scanning them all or transcribing the notes would be a ton
of work that doesn’t seem worth it.  I could also just throw them away,
but storing them is pretty cheap.  And so for now they sit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lecture notes:</strong> I don’t like to put everything I’m going to say on
my lecture slides.  I think it’s confusing when students don’t know when
to listen to me or read the screen. Ideally, my slides just highlight the
organization and important points and include the occasional figure,
table, or dramatic photograph.  I tend to have a bunch of written notes
that go along with each lecture that I refer to while I’m talking or writing on
the board.  Slowly but surely I’m putting these notes into <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/why-markdown-a-two-minute-explanation/">Markdown</a>
documents that I can refer to while I teach, but for now I have a lot of
physical folders.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mostly paperless has been great for me because my bag is lighter and I
now have access to almost everything I need from almost everywhere.  It
makes sharing documents easier and I can index digital assets on
multiple dimensions.  Those debates about whether aricles should get
stored by author or by topic or by project are long gone since it’s easy
to do all three.  Paperless is also great for trees because they can
stay where they are soaking up sun and CO2 instead of being ground into
pulp and mixed with smelly chemicals.</p>

<p>100% paperless is kind of like enlightenment.  It’s extremely
hard (if not impossible) to achieve, but there are great rewards for
striving to get there.</p>
