<div class="entry-content"><p>So I got my iPhone 5 about a week ago (pre-ordered from AT&amp;T) and have
barely been able to brag about it to anyone since most of my local
friends aren’t nearly as nerdy as I am.  Then I remembered that I had a
blog and decided the world needed hear all about my new device.</p>

<p>But first, a little background: Two years ago I started carrying an
iPhone 4 and a year ago I was only slightly tempted to upgrade to a 4S.
The camera was a little better, the cpu was a little faster, and it had
Siri which I didn’t think I’d use much.  And I would have had to pay the
one year upgrade penalty.  I passed.  Fast-forward to this year and I
was champing at the bit for something new.  </p>

<p>And so, without further ado, here’s what I’d say if you saw me on the
street and said “Ooh, is that an iPhone 5?  How do you like it?”</p>

<h2 id="big-stuff">Big Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>Camera:</strong> It’s way better.  Low light pictures look a lot better, but
 the thing I really notice is the speed.  It launches quickly (the 4 was
 a dog), and you can tap away at the shutter seemingly several times a
 second.  It’s a life-saver when you have an older daughter who loves
 funny faces and chewing on her own hair, but occasionally flashes the
 most beautiful smile you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p><strong>Maps:</strong> I get it that if you live in a place where the coverage stinks,
 the new Maps app stinks too.  But in New Haven, the coverage is fine.
 And it’s huge upgrade over IOS 5 both in terms of features and UI.
 Turn-by-turn voice directions are extremely well integrated–much nicer
 and more functional than either Tom Tom or Navigon.  I love that you
 can flip back and forth between the 2D map of your route and the 3D
 rendering of where you are on the route.  The vector-based tiles are
 prettier and faster to download too.  I’m glad I have the Tom Tom app,
which stores maps locally, for when I’m out of cell range, but let’s
 be honest: that hasn’t happened in years and it will be a while before
 it happens again.</p>

<p><strong>CPU:</strong> It’s way faster.  I have a shortcut on my home screen that launches
OmniFocus and goes straight to “new task” screen.  It used to take about
5 seconds, but now it’s less than a second.  All sorts of other stuff
loads and runs faster too.</p>

<p><strong>64 GB flash:</strong> In this cloud-based age we live in, local storage isn’t
 supposed to matter since your apps should just be able to pull in what
 you need from the net as you need it.  But as I’ve complained bitterly
 about <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/19041134391/photos-iphoto-ios-icloud-im-underwhelmed">already</a>, Apple’s vision of cloud photography is currently
 Photo Stream.  Ugh.  With double the room on my device, both my wife
 and I can stop carefully deciding what pictures and home videos we have
 space for.  Some day <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/revel.html">Adobe Revel</a> might solve this more elegantly,
 but for now they don’t do video and they don’t have a Windows app.</p>

<h2 id="little-stuff">Little Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>The physical device:</strong> Yeah, it’s nice.  But my eyes aren’t good enough to
really appreciate the straight lines and shiny camfer.  And it’s really
thin, especially since I’m going caseless for now compared to my old
rubber-clad 4.  It feels great in the pocket but it’s surprisingly hard
to pick up off a counter or desk!  My wife thinks it feels a little like
a Nano, and she’s right.</p>

<p><strong>Screen:</strong> I can’t tell if the colors are more saturated or if the pixels
are closer to the surface but supposedly they are.  It’s nice to have
more text on the screen in portrait mode, but this is partially offset
by the awkwardness of moving my thumb to the opposite top corner.  This
has become easier with time, so I’m guessing I’ll completely
adjust soon.  The extra row of icons is useful as my home screen was
getting a little cramped.  I rarely venture to my other screens now, and
that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Lightning:</strong> I like it a lot–it’s durable, tiny, and easy since it’s
double-sided.  It’s a little annoying that I now need different cables
for my phone and iPad, but Apple had to upgrade this connector
eventually and I think we’ll have Lightning for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>LTE:</strong> in some ways, this is the biggest new feature of the phone. When
you’re near an LTE tower, it’s crazy fast–the other day SpeedTest gave
me 28Mbps downstream and 12 Mbps upstream.  That’s 3x and 8x faster than
my U-Verse at home!  Of course, per byte, it’s expensive and I’m on wifi
90% of the time.  And right now, AT&amp;T’s coverage isn’t that great.</p>

<p><strong>Siri:</strong> We’re still just getting to know each other, but I like what I
 hear so far.  It’s absolutely the fastest way to enter new appointments
 on my calendar.  Last Friday I asked “What was the score in last
 night’s NFL game?” and got the box score in moments.  I use it to set
 alarms.  I expected to enjoy the novelty of it and then forget about
 it, but instead my usage seems to be increasing.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts:</h2>

<p>This phone did not need a whole bunch of fancy new features (e.g.,
curved AMOLED display, NFC, giant screen) to be fantastic.  The iPhone
has been fantastic since they introduced it in 2007.  I find it amazing
that they’ve been able to make it incrementally better every year by
refining and improving what it already does.  And yet the tech press
keeps wanting the next iPhone to be a quantum leap.  That’s not how
how it works.  Truly revolutionary devices aren’t 5.0’s, they are
1.0’s.</p>
