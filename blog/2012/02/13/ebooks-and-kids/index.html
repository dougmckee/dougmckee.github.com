<div class="entry-content"><p>In my house we read a lot of books to our kids.  We read after school,
on weekends, while traveling, during meals and (of course) right before
bed.  I was a voracious reader as a kid and I hope to impart this habit
and pure love of reading to my kids.  There&#8217;s something about reading a
book and visualizing the scenes and action in your mind that expands
your imagination much more than watching a movie ever could.  Reading
with your kids is also a just high quality parent-child time.  You never
have to press pause to stop and talk about issues raised in the story.</p>

<p>We also run a fairly gadget-friendly household.  My wife and I often
work at our computers, we both have iPhones, and our iPad is pretty much
our living room computer.  My three-year old has almost as many apps as
I do.  You would think we would be actively transitioning all our
reading to e-books, but we&#8217;re not.</p>

<h3><strong>The Good</strong></h3>

<p>E-books have a lot of advantages over physical books.  I love that you
can load up an iPad with a few hundred and it weighs no more than a
couple paperbacks.  While picture books look like junk (if they are
available at all) on the Kindle, they look fine on the iPad.  Some
e-books have a &#8220;read aloud&#8221; option and will repeat words and sentences
with a touch.  We don&#8217;t use these features much as a parent is usually the one
reading, but it&#8217;s nice to have the option.</p>

<p>Pricing of e-books is generally higher than the used physical book
price, but I think (hope?) it&#8217;s only a matter of time before that changes.
I especially hope that the publishers realize that parents would love to
buy &#8220;boxed sets&#8221; for a reasonable price.  If I could buy all 26 of the Curious
George books in the iBooks store for $52 (that&#8217;s $2 each) I&#8217;d jump on
it.  Instead, they charge between $3.99 and $8.99 each and I end up
spending a total of $3.99 on George.  We all lose out.</p>

<p>Availability is a similar story&#8211;it&#8217;s lousy now but I have high hopes it
will get better.  The great thing will be that once a book is in digital
format, there&#8217;s no reason it should ever go out of print.  So when I
want a mint condition copy of Amy Tan&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sagwa-Chinese-Siamese-Cat-Amy/dp/0689846177">Sagwa, The Chinese Siamese Cat</a>
I don&#8217;t have to wait a single minute.  And if libraries can get in on
the action, their catalogs will be amazing.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad</strong></h3>

<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, the current pricing and availability
situation is atrocious for kids&#8217; books.  But these aren&#8217;t the only
problems.</p>

<p>My iPad has a 9.7 inch display.  The vast majority of the kids&#8217; books in
our house are a lot bigger.  That means you either see a small version
of the page or you&#8217;re constantly panning and zooming.  Graeme Bass&#8217;
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Golden-Snail-Graeme-Base/dp/0810989654">Legend of the Golden Snail</a>
is 12 inches by 22 inches open.  That&#8217;s 25 inches diagonal
(according to Pythagoras) and it&#8217;s going to be a long time before tablet
displays get that big.  The resolution on a printed page is a lot better
than my iPad today, but that could presumably <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/12/ipad-3-to-pave-way-for-1080p-itunes-content-and-a-new-apple-tv/">change in the next month
or so</a>.
And you can completely forget about duplicating the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394873742">Richard Scarry&#8217;s
Biggest Word Book Ever!</a>
experience&#8211;it opens to 32 inches by 24 inches.</p>

<p>Even if I&#8217;m willing to give in on all this stuff for my three-year-old,
there&#8217;s no way an e-book works for a one-year-old.  We have close to 100
board books, touch and feel books, and cloth books that can withstand
constant mouthing and provide good tactile feedback.</p>

<h3><strong>The Worrying</strong></h3>

<p>I&#8217;m mostly optimistic about the future of e-books for kids, but there
is a trend that worries me.  The kids&#8217; e-books that get the most praise
from critics and the highest ratings in the iOS app store tend to be the
flashiest and most movie-like.  Sesame Street&#8217;s
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monster-at-end-this-book...starring/id409467802">The Monster at the End of This Book</a>
is a perfect example.  It lasted about 5 minutes on my iPad before I saw
my daughter&#8217;s eyes glaze over and I deleted it.  The Critter books
(e.g.,
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/just-me-and-my-dad-for-ipad/id364723303">Just Me and My Dad</a>)
aren&#8217;t much better.  They at least let you read the story while you
click around the page trying to make animals do funny things.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I think interactive features are a bad thing in e-books,
but I think they are a lot more appropriate in books for adults like
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847">The Elements: A Visual Exploration</a>
and Al Gore&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id432753658">Our Choice</a>.
Even textbooks has a lot to gain from embedded movie clips, social
network integration, and dynamic graphs.  And I&#8217;m excited about the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a> software enabling a
whole new wave of these kinds of books.</p>

<p>But God help us if children&#8217;s book publishers suddenly think they have tart up old
content to get us to buy it electronically.  Let my daughters and I
imagine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curious-George-Rides-Bike-Rey/dp/0395174449">George riding his bike</a> in the circus without turning it into
mini-game.  Let us laugh about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">Franklin&#8217;s messy closet</a> without having to
interactively explore it.  And let us imagine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Book-Margaret-Brown/dp/0061119776">old lady whispering
&#8220;hush&#8221;</a> without having to hear it out loud.</p>
