<div class="entry-content"><p>In my house we read a lot of books to our kids.  We read after school,
on weekends, while traveling, during meals and (of course) right before
bed.  I was a voracious reader as a kid and I hope to impart this habit
and pure love of reading to my kids.  There’s something about reading a
book and visualizing the scenes and action in your mind that expands
your imagination much more than watching a movie ever could.  Reading
with your kids is also a just high quality parent-child time.  You never
have to press pause to stop and talk about issues raised in the story.</p>

<p>We also run a fairly gadget-friendly household.  My wife and I often
work at our computers, we both have iPhones, and our iPad is pretty much
our living room computer.  My three-year old has almost as many apps as
I do.  You would think we would be actively transitioning all our
reading to e-books, but we’re not.</p>

<h3 id="the-good"><strong>The Good</strong></h3>

<p>E-books have a lot of advantages over physical books.  I love that you
can load up an iPad with a few hundred and it weighs no more than a
couple paperbacks.  While picture books look like junk (if they are
available at all) on the Kindle, they look fine on the iPad.  Some
e-books have a “read aloud” option and will repeat words and sentences
with a touch.  We don’t use these features much as a parent is usually the one
reading, but it’s nice to have the option.</p>

<p>Pricing of e-books is generally higher than the used physical book
price, but I think (hope?) it’s only a matter of time before that changes.
I especially hope that the publishers realize that parents would love to
buy “boxed sets” for a reasonable price.  If I could buy all 26 of the Curious
George books in the iBooks store for $52 (that’s $2 each) I’d jump on
it.  Instead, they charge between $3.99 and $8.99 each and I end up
spending a total of $3.99 on George.  We all lose out.</p>

<p>Availability is a similar story–it’s lousy now but I have high hopes it
will get better.  The great thing will be that once a book is in digital
format, there’s no reason it should ever go out of print.  So when I
want a mint condition copy of Amy Tan’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sagwa-Chinese-Siamese-Cat-Amy/dp/0689846177">Sagwa, The Chinese Siamese Cat</a>
I don’t have to wait a single minute.  And if libraries can get in on
the action, their catalogs will be amazing.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad"><strong>The Bad</strong></h3>

<p>As I’ve already mentioned, the current pricing and availability
situation is atrocious for kids’ books.  But these aren’t the only
problems.</p>

<p>My iPad has a 9.7 inch display.  The vast majority of the kids’ books in
our house are a lot bigger.  That means you either see a small version
of the page or you’re constantly panning and zooming.  Graeme Bass’
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Golden-Snail-Graeme-Base/dp/0810989654">Legend of the Golden Snail</a>
is 12 inches by 22 inches open.  That’s 25 inches diagonal
(according to Pythagoras) and it’s going to be a long time before tablet
displays get that big.  The resolution on a printed page is a lot better
than my iPad today, but that could presumably <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/12/ipad-3-to-pave-way-for-1080p-itunes-content-and-a-new-apple-tv/">change in the next month or so</a>.
And you can completely forget about duplicating the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394873742">Richard Scarry’s Biggest Word Book Ever!</a>
experience–it opens to 32 inches by 24 inches.</p>

<p>Even if I’m willing to give in on all this stuff for my three-year-old,
there’s no way an e-book works for a one-year-old.  We have close to 100
board books, touch and feel books, and cloth books that can withstand
constant mouthing and provide good tactile feedback.  </p>

<h3 id="the-worrying"><strong>The Worrying</strong></h3>

<p>I’m mostly optimistic about the future of e-books for kids, but there
is a trend that worries me.  The kids’ e-books that get the most praise
from critics and the highest ratings in the iOS app store tend to be the
flashiest and most movie-like.  Sesame Street’s
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monster-at-end-this-book...starring/id409467802">The Monster at the End of This Book</a>
is a perfect example.  It lasted about 5 minutes on my iPad before I saw
my daughter’s eyes glaze over and I deleted it.  The Critter books
(e.g.,
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/just-me-and-my-dad-for-ipad/id364723303">Just Me and My Dad</a>)
aren’t much better.  They at least let you read the story while you
click around the page trying to make animals do funny things.</p>

<p>It’s not that I think interactive features are a bad thing in e-books,
but I think they are a lot more appropriate in books for adults like
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847">The Elements: A Visual Exploration</a>
and Al Gore’s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id432753658">Our Choice</a>.
Even textbooks has a lot to gain from embedded movie clips, social
network integration, and dynamic graphs.  And I’m excited about the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a> software enabling a
whole new wave of these kinds of books.</p>

<p>But God help us if children’s book publishers suddenly think they have tart up old
content to get us to buy it electronically.  Let my daughters and I
imagine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curious-George-Rides-Bike-Rey/dp/0395174449">George riding his bike</a> in the circus without turning it into
mini-game.  Let us laugh about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">Franklin’s messy closet</a> without having to
interactively explore it.  And let us imagine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Book-Margaret-Brown/dp/0061119776">old lady whispering “hush”</a> without having to hear it out loud.</p>
