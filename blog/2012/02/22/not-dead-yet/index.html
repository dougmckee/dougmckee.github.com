<div class="entry-content"><p>Believe it or not, new wave isn’t dead.  It may not be popular anymore,
but several bands that haven’t had a hit in the US since the eighties
are still producing great music.  And I mean <strong>new</strong> music—they aren’t
just not milking their catalog for “new” remixes and playing the state
fair circuit in the summer.</p>

<p>While not all this new music is any good, you will be happy to know that
I’ve done the hard work of listening to it over the last couple weeks to
separate the wheat from the crap.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_League">The Human League</a> are
(is?) absolutely the most under-rated new wave band of the eighties.
About ten years ago I saw an eighties triple bill headlined by Boy
George. He was good, but the Human League were totally unexpectedly
fantastic. They nailed their old stuff (like (I’m Only) “Human”,
“Fascination”, and “Don’t You Want Me”) and their then new stuff (from
<em>Secrets</em> 2001) was just as good. It totally holds up today and I even
love their 2011 album <em>Credo</em>. Except for the more contemporary dance
beat on the lead track (Never Let Me Go) it could have been released in
1983.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys">The Pet Shop Boys</a>
disappeared from the US music scene at the end of the eighties, but,
just like Kylie Minogue, they have continued putting out hit album after
hit album in the UK.  They’re still sensitive and synthy but their music has
matured with them in a really good way.  My favorite of their recent
work is <em>Release</em> (2002), but the dance remixes of <em>Fundamental</em> (2006)
are a lot of fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey">Morrissey:</a> I loved the Smiths
and would have cried when they broke up if I hadn’t discovered them long
after the break-up had already happened.  Morrissey has amazingly just
continued to put out solid albums in the years since and thoroughly
proven that he was the talented one and that Johnny Marr (like Wham’s
Andrew Ridgely) was just along for the ride.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode">Depeche Mode</a> I’ll be
honest–I’m not one of those totally nutty Depeche Mode fans who believe
Dave Gahan is God.  And I left them behind after <em>Violator</em> (1989) even
though “Policy of Truth” is one of my all time favorite songs.  But they
do continue to produce music and I did take a chance on <em>Playing the
Angel</em> (2005).  It has one good track (“Precious”) and the rest is
crap.  Am I still bitter about that?  Yes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure">The Cure</a> The Cure are an
amazing band and certainly Robert Smith is closer to God than Dave
Gahan.  Their range, from minimalist early new wave to syrupy pop to
wall of sound, is impressive.  When I saw them in 2003, I was blown away
by Smith’s guitar playing of all things.  That said, I’m not a huge fan
of their recent stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears">Tears for Fears</a> Their
first two albums (<em>The Hurting</em> and <em>Songs from the Big Chair</em>) hold up
surprisingly well, but <em>Seeds of Love</em> was a little goofy even for me.
They broke up in 1991 and Roland Orzabal released two kind of lousy
albums still using the band’s name.  They got back together and released
<em>Everyone Loves a Happy Ending</em> in 2004 and I’ve tried to like it over
the past few days.  It sounds just like <em>Seeds of Love</em> and I’ll let you
decide if that’s good or bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Jones_(musician)">Howard Jones</a>
opened the same triple bill I mentioned above and I had such high hopes
since I absolutely played <em>Dream Into Action</em> into the ground when I was
in high school.  Shoot, I still listen to it all the time!
Unfortunately, the show was a big let down and everything he’s recorded
since <em>In the Running</em> (1992) is in my opinion unlistenable.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ha">A-ha!</a> Most American’s think of A-ha
as that one-hit wonder with the fun cartoony music video, but they
happen to be the biggest band ever out of Norway and just broke up in
2010.  It’s kind of hard to find their albums (read: they aren’t in the
iTunes Store), but they do have a greatest hits (<em>The Singles:
1984-2004)</em>) that I’ve been enjoying.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaville_(band)">Alphaville</a> Released in
1984, “Big in Japan” and “Forever Young” are absolutely quintessential
eighties new wave songs.  I have a soft spot for their second (less
successful) album, <em>Afternoons in Utopia</em> (1986) since I wore out the
the cassette I copied from my freshman dorm roommate.  But I just can’t
listen to anything they’ve released since.  And I’ve tried.</p>

<p>If you’ve managed to read to the bottom of this too-long post, you
probably you loved the work of these guys (and girls) back in the day.
I strongly recommend giving some of their newer stuff a listen.  If
you’re pleasantly surprised, keep an eye out for an upcoming post about
newer bands that emulate this style even though it guarantees they’ll
never get rich or even played on the radio. Hint: it’s now called
SynthPop–maybe the world’s dorkiest musical genre.</p>
