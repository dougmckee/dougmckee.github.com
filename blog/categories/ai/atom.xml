    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the Internet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Welty">Chris Welty</a> is now a research scientist at IBM’s TJ Watson Research Center in upstate New York.  He works on knowledge representation and the semantic web and was one of the developers behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)">Watson</a>, the computer program that kicked ass on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a>  He also taught Intro to Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer</a> in the late 1980’s. As far as I know, he is alive and well. But life comes and goes and I really like the idea of writing this  while he is still around to read it. You don’t always get <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/01/05/dr-bob-cupper">that chance</a>. </p>

<p>I showed up at Rensselaer in 1986 extremely excited to learn how to turn computers into people.  I grew up on science fiction like Asimov’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot">I Robot</a> and was certain we were on the threshold of true software-based intelligent beings.  I knew the average person wasn’t that smart–how hard could it possibly be to write code that could simulate their basic skills?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>In the spring of my sophomore year I took Professor Welty’s Intro to AI class and it was everything I could have hoped for. Professor Welty was not quite as young as I was, but he was certainly as excited as any of us about the box full toys we got to play with.  Mini-max algorithms, backward-chaining, forward chaining, Lisp, semantic networks–I could go on and on. I put serious work into that class, but it was also a serious amount of fun.  This was the only class in college that actually inspired me to work all night on projects.</p>

<p>You might think that with subject matter this good, anyone could have taught a great class, but you’d be wrong.  Now that I spend big chunks of my own time standing in the front of the classroom, I realize all the work he put in and the skills he had.  The problem sets were engaging. The in-class explanations of concepts were clear and polished and yet the classes were very conversational.  In Professor Welty’s class everyone felt comfortable raising their hand.</p>

<p>I don’t do AI anymore, but I use what I learned in that class every day: Hold yourself to a high standard.  Be present. Share. Do what you love. Have fun.  Thanks Professor Welty!</p>

      <p>It turns out to be very hard, but it also took me many more years to figure that out.  <a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
