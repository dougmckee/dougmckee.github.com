    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/05/20/seminars/">how I like to run seminar classes</a> before and you may have noticed that my approach is decidedly low tech. My students read the week’s articles before class and fill out a “worksheet” for each one. Before this semester, the most important question on the worksheet was “What didn’t you understand?” I would look over their answers to identify weak spots that we would  cover in class.</p>

<p>This semester I tried something new: I took “What didn’t you understand?” off the worksheet and asked my students to post questions they had about the reading on a <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a> online discussion forum. If two (or more) students have the same question, only the first has to post it–the others could just mark it as a “good question.” They could also answer each other’s questions and I could “approve” answers or provide my own. I had high hopes for the new system. I thought it would be easier for the students, and would make it easier for me to see what the hot button issues were and even provide some feedback before class. </p>

<p>It didn’t work very well. Even with a fair amount of cajoling during the semester, I would only get 4-5 students (of 24) participating in the forum each week. Based on feedback during the last class, it seems there were three primary reasons. First, it wasn’t clear to many of them that they could post their questions anonymously and they didn’t want to embarrass themselves in front of their fellow students by posting potentially “dumb” questions. Second, several students felt they were done with the assignment after they filled out their worksheets. They didn’t want to take the time to go to the Piazza web site for more work. Third, they didn’t like posting questions that weren’t going to get answered on the forum.</p>

<p>I’m not ready to give up on the idea, but I’m also not sure what to do differently next semester. I can try more cajoling on the first day of class and I can let everyone know that they can post anonymously. I can also commit to answering questions before class. The worksheets and questions are due on Monday night, so that gives me plenty of time before Wednesday’s class to provide at least basic answers. I’m still not sure this will be enough to get mass participation.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/04/three-great-product-features/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/04/three-great-product-features</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great products get reviewed and talked about, but great features of good products often fly under the radar. They can seem obvious in hindsight or just have a niche group that really appreciates them. Here are three of my favorites that deserve more notice.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-control-center.png %}</p>

<p><strong>1. Control Center</strong></p>

<p>Hands down my favorite new feature of iOS 7, the Control Center removes lots of little dead moments from my life. Every night I lock my phone into portrait mode when I get in bed. I use the flashlight at least twice a day. I select an Airplay destination or use the music controls about twice a day. And in the morning I free up the phone’s orientation again. Since I don’t even have to unlock the phone to do any of this, it saves me at least five seconds each time. That adds up to a minimum of 30 seconds a day and three whole hours a year.</p>

<p>{% img left /images/hv-whispersync.jpg %}</p>

<p><strong>2. Whispersync</strong></p>

<p>After the kids go to sleep and I’m cleaning the kitchen or putting toys away, I like to listen to audiobooks. When it’s particularly gripping, I continue to read the book on my phone in bed using the Kindle app. Whispersync means I automatically pick up right where I left off on the audio. The next night when I start listening again, the Audible app jumps to where I was in the e-book. I can’t imagine too many people take advantage of this, but I love it. </p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-sneeze-shield.jpg %}</p>

<p><strong>3. Sneeze Shield</strong></p>

<p>Maybe our bedroom is dusty. Maybe I have allergies. Maybe I get a lot of low-grade colds. I don’t know why I sneeze a few times almost every morning when I wake up, but I do. And with two little kids, we all get our share of normal-grade colds. This means we go through a lot of tissues. Sneeze Shield means the tissue doesn’t fall apart when a grown up blows into it. I don’t miss handfuls of wet snot at all.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/29/pq2-loom/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/29/pq2-loom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Note: You might want to read <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/09/im-not-happy/">my first photo management rant</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/04/30/pq1-adobe-revel-and-everpix">Part 1</a> for context.)</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-loom.png %}</p>

<p>Ever since
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">Everpix went belly up</a>,
photo management has been a common topic on the blogs I read and the
podcasts I listen to. The current
<a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/our-favorite-photo-stream-alternative/">consensus favorite</a>
is <a href="http://www.loom.com">Loom</a> and when I read their feature list I was
pretty excited. They seemlessly sync your iOS Camera Roll and your Mac’s
iPhoto Library with the cloud. Unlike Everpix, they store original files
instead of lossy compressed versions. Unlike Everpix and Adobe Revel,
they store photos AND videos. Their web app lets you browse your photo
collection from anywhere. I loved that you could create and manage
albums of photos from anywhere. Even their pricing ($40/yr for 50GB and
$99/yr for 255GB) was reasonable.</p>

<p>I signed up for the service, and while it took longer than I thought it
should, the iOS app eventually pushed my 300 photo Camera Roll up to the
cloud.  After enjoyably browsing this little collection on my phone,
iPad, and Mac (using the web app), I decided to pony up for a month of 255GB
of storage and try uploading my whole iPhoto library.  I won’t bore you
with the details, but after six days of synchronization hangs, duplicate
photos, and unanswered support email, I gave up.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the problem was just me as I haven’t found anyone
else complaining about Loom synchronization on the web.  My internet
connection’s upload speed is not that great–just 1.5 Mbps–but this is
the first time I’ve had a product give me trouble. Dropbox has been
successfully syncing more than 50 GB of files for about three years now
and I have used BackBlaze to successfully replicate about a terabyte of data.</p>

<p>I found the whole experience rather depressing. The service even on paper
wasn’t perfect. They don’t remove duplicate photos. They don’t offer
even rudimentary editing tools. They won’t stream videos through any of
their apps. They won’t synchronize folders on Windows machines with the
cloud. That said, their feature set was above my bar and they seemed
like they were moving in the right direction.  This time software
quality was the show stopper. </p>

<p>Sigh. The quest continues.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/30/markdown-and-me/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/30/markdown-and-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of my time creating and editing plain text files. It isn’t the prettiest or most powerful format for documents, but I still love it.  Plain text is trivial to copy and paste between applications, and the files are human readable.  Unlike .doc files, PDF files, or even RTF files, there are a gazillion apps that will show and edit text. And the format has staying power–it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">been around since the 1960’s</a> and I’m willing to bet it will be easy to work with in 20 years and maybe even 50 years. </p>

<p>Markdown is an extremely simple but incredibly powerful way to add a bit of formatting to plain text without losing any of plain text’s benefits.  When I write with Markdown, I can still use my favorite editing applications. At the same time, I can have section headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more.  Markdown does a lot of what HTML was originally designed to do but is much easier to write and much easier to read. It’s also easy to translate Markdown into any of these other formats when you need them. </p>

<p>My favorite thing about Markdown is that there is almost no learning curve–most people already use pieces of it without realizing it. If you want to <em>emphasize</em> a few <strong>words</strong>, you put <code>*one*</code> or <code>**two**</code> stars around them. If you want to make a bulleted list, you use stars for that too.  </p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>turns into this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>You nest lists by indenting them:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
	* Fuji
	* Braeburn
	* McIntosh
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>to create this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples
    <ul>
      <li>Fuji</li>
      <li>Braeburn</li>
      <li>McIntosh</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>Other stuff like marking headings with hashmarks or embedding links is straight-forward too. John Gruber invented Markdown in 2004 and the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">original spec</a> is still a great description of the language.</p>

<p>I use Markdown for tons of stuff.  This includes the notes that go along with every one of my lectures and presentations.  I can write them quickly and then have them display nicely on my iPad while I talk and walk around the room. I also take all my meeting notes in Markdown and sometimes share them with other meeting attendees. I write all my blog posts in Markdown and let Octopress/Jekyll automatically turn them into pretty HTML.</p>

<p>I don’t (yet) use Markdown for everything.  My research articles are mostly written in Latex which does a much better job with mathematical equations and big structured documents.  I use MS Word when I am collaborating with someone who is more comfortable in that environment. My class syllabi are still in Latex, but even though I could probably switch, it might be more trouble than it’s worth.  And while I often draft my slide content in Markdown, it almost always ends up in a set of PowerPoint slides where I have much greater control over the layout.</p>

<p>On the Mac, I use <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">emacs</a>  and <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a> to edit standalone Markdown files like blog posts and lecture notes.  I like emacs because I’ve been using it for 20 years and it’s really an extension of my brain at this point. It’s also what I use for editing code.  On the other hand, it’s kind of ugly.  FoldingText lets me hide/show sections of my document easily and makes my documents look pretty while I edit them by doing things like bolding text surrounded by double stars and hiding the actual double stars unless my cursor is on the bolded words.  It does the same sort of thing for links.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> on my Mac to edit and manage all my meeting notes and miscellaneous notes. When editing, it just shows the raw text, but I can always hold down the control key to see the pretty version of the text.  nvAlt is super-easy to search and it stores all the notes as separate files on dropbox so I can easily migrate to some other app if the mood strikes.</p>

<p>On my iPhone, I use <a href="http://writeup.prasannag.com">WriteUp</a> to edit standalone files like this blog post right now since it syncs so easily with Dropbox.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notesy-for-dropbox/id386095500?mt=8">Notesy</a> syncs perfectly with nvAlt on the Mac.  On the iPad, Writeup displays my lecture notes beautifully and gives me the option to make last minute edits.</p>

<p>If this post piques your interest, there’s great info about Markdown all over the web. Perhaps the single best resource is a <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">new book</a> by David Sparks and Eddie Smith that gathers a whole bunch of Markdown info in one place.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Exams and Online Classes]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/23/exams-and-online-classes/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/23/exams-and-online-classes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With just a few exceptions, no one likes exams.  Students don’t like the stress of taking the exams, instructors have to write the exams, and someone usually has to grade them. In-class exams don’t give enough time for testing very much material, and if the test is too long, it punishes students who know their stuff but are just a little slow. Take-home exams can cover more content, but it can be very tempting for students to cheat by getting help from friends or the Internet. Unfortunately, we need objective assessments of how much each student has mastered the course material, and right now exams are the best tool we have.</p>

<p>In an online class, exams are even trickier.  In my econometrics class this summer, we held our midterm and final exams in the virtual classroom.  At exam time, I emailed them a PDF with all the questions and my students wrote their answers on paper while my teaching assistant and I watched them through their webcams. We used pencil and paper because answering the questions required doing a fair amount of math and I wanted to see their work.  I didn’t want them to use valuable time slowly typing in symbols and equations. After two hours, they scanned their written answers (mostly with their phone cameras) and emailed them to me.  When I confirmed receipt and readability, the students were free to go.  </p>

<p>The process was easy and convenient, but had one major flaw: it would have been pretty easy to cheat. I say this believing in my heart that none of my students cheated and having absolutely no evidence to even make me suspicious.  Even so, any one of them could have forwarded the exam PDF to a friend (or professional) and had them email back their answers.  The incentives for doing so are actually quite strong: Yale classes are not cheap and they get real Yale credit for my online class. Not to mention the fact that most elite college students care a lot about their GPA.</p>

<p>A second problem we ran into was that students’ Internet connections were not always reliable.  When these connections dropped, some students didn’t even notice for a while and others had trouble reconnecting.  It wouldn’t have been fair to just disqualify those students, but again, it was a pretty huge opportunity to cheat. </p>

<p>We considered three alternative testing procedures, but I think only one would be a clear improvement over what we did.  First, we thought about requiring students to have a separate webcam that would let us view their computer screen.  In this scenario, they couldn’t use their computer for evil, but I still think it would be relatively easy for them to cheat with an alternative device outside the frame of view.  Second, we investigated using an online service that locks down their computer for only exam taking purposes. <a href="https://webassessor.com">Webassessor</a> provides this service along with online proctors, but it would also require good webcam placement.  And both of these alternatives are still reliant on continuous connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>The solution I like best is to use an in-person testing service where students go to a controlled physical location to take their exam.  <a href="https://www.prometric.com">Prometric</a> has more than 10,000 test taking centers all over the world–that means a huge fraction of the world’s population is within two hours drive of a center so it’s not all that inconvenient to travel to one one or two times during a course.</p>

<p>Timing is an issue for all these solutions–that is, you’d like all your students to take the exam simultaneously so the early students can’t share information with those that take the exam later.  If your students are scattered around the globe, at least some of them will have to take their exam in the middle of the night and that doesn’t seem fair.  My students in the far east had to take their exams at either 10pm or 11pm.  One way around this problem would be to have two versions of the exam–one for each half of the planet.</p>

<p>Next time I teach an online class where the stakes are high, I’m going to try to use a service like Prometric.  I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>
