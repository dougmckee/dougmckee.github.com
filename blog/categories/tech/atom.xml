    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great products get reviewed and talked about, but great features of good products often fly under the radar. They can seem obvious in hindsight or just have a niche group that really appreciates them. Here are three of my favorites that deserve more notice.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-control-center.png %}</p>

<p><strong>1. Control Center</strong></p>

<p>Hands down my favorite new feature of iOS 7, the Control Center removes lots of little dead moments from my life. Every night I lock my phone into portrait mode when I get in bed. I use the flashlight at least twice a day. I select an Airplay destination or use the music controls about twice a day. And in the morning I free up the phone’s orientation again. Since I don’t even have to unlock the phone to do any of this, it saves me at least five seconds each time. That adds up to a minimum of 30 seconds a day and three whole hours a year.</p>

<p>{% img left /images/hv-whispersync.jpg %}</p>

<p><strong>2. Whispersync</strong></p>

<p>After the kids go to sleep and I’m cleaning the kitchen or putting toys away, I like to listen to audiobooks. When it’s particularly gripping, I continue to read the book on my phone in bed using the Kindle app. Whispersync means I automatically pick up right where I left off on the audio. The next night when I start listening again, the Audible app jumps to where I was in the e-book. I can’t imagine too many people take advantage of this, but I love it. </p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-sneeze-shield.jpg %}</p>

<p><strong>3. Sneeze Shield</strong></p>

<p>Maybe our bedroom is dusty. Maybe I have allergies. Maybe I get a lot of low-grade colds. I don’t know why I sneeze a few times almost every morning when I wake up, but I do. And with two little kids, we all get our share of normal-grade colds. This means we go through a lot of tissues. Sneeze Shield means the tissue doesn’t fall apart when a grown up blows into it. I don’t miss handfuls of wet snot at all.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/29/pq2-loom/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/29/pq2-loom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Note: You might want to read <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/09/im-not-happy/">my first photo management rant</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/04/30/pq1-adobe-revel-and-everpix">Part 1</a> for context.)</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-loom.png %}</p>

<p>Ever since
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">Everpix went belly up</a>,
photo management has been a common topic on the blogs I read and the
podcasts I listen to. The current
<a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/our-favorite-photo-stream-alternative/">consensus favorite</a>
is <a href="http://www.loom.com">Loom</a> and when I read their feature list I was
pretty excited. They seemlessly sync your iOS Camera Roll and your Mac’s
iPhoto Library with the cloud. Unlike Everpix, they store original files
instead of lossy compressed versions. Unlike Everpix and Adobe Revel,
they store photos AND videos. Their web app lets you browse your photo
collection from anywhere. I loved that you could create and manage
albums of photos from anywhere. Even their pricing ($40/yr for 50GB and
$99/yr for 255GB) was reasonable.</p>

<p>I signed up for the service, and while it took longer than I thought it
should, the iOS app eventually pushed my 300 photo Camera Roll up to the
cloud.  After enjoyably browsing this little collection on my phone,
iPad, and Mac (using the web app), I decided to pony up for a month of 255GB
of storage and try uploading my whole iPhoto library.  I won’t bore you
with the details, but after six days of synchronization hangs, duplicate
photos, and unanswered support email, I gave up.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the problem was just me as I haven’t found anyone
else complaining about Loom synchronization on the web.  My internet
connection’s upload speed is not that great–just 1.5 Mbps–but this is
the first time I’ve had a product give me trouble. Dropbox has been
successfully syncing more than 50 GB of files for about three years now
and I have used BackBlaze to successfully replicate about a terabyte of data.</p>

<p>I found the whole experience rather depressing. The service even on paper
wasn’t perfect. They don’t remove duplicate photos. They don’t offer
even rudimentary editing tools. They won’t stream videos through any of
their apps. They won’t synchronize folders on Windows machines with the
cloud. That said, their feature set was above my bar and they seemed
like they were moving in the right direction.  This time software
quality was the show stopper. </p>

<p>Sigh. The quest continues.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/30/markdown-and-me/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/30/markdown-and-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of my time creating and editing plain text files. It isn’t the prettiest or most powerful format for documents, but I still love it.  Plain text is trivial to copy and paste between applications, and the files are human readable.  Unlike .doc files, PDF files, or even RTF files, there are a gazillion apps that will show and edit text. And the format has staying power–it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">been around since the 1960’s</a> and I’m willing to bet it will be easy to work with in 20 years and maybe even 50 years. </p>

<p>Markdown is an extremely simple but incredibly powerful way to add a bit of formatting to plain text without losing any of plain text’s benefits.  When I write with Markdown, I can still use my favorite editing applications. At the same time, I can have section headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more.  Markdown does a lot of what HTML was originally designed to do but is much easier to write and much easier to read. It’s also easy to translate Markdown into any of these other formats when you need them. </p>

<p>My favorite thing about Markdown is that there is almost no learning curve–most people already use pieces of it without realizing it. If you want to <em>emphasize</em> a few <strong>words</strong>, you put <code>*one*</code> or <code>**two**</code> stars around them. If you want to make a bulleted list, you use stars for that too.  </p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>turns into this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>You nest lists by indenting them:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
	* Fuji
	* Braeburn
	* McIntosh
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>to create this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples
    <ul>
      <li>Fuji</li>
      <li>Braeburn</li>
      <li>McIntosh</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>Other stuff like marking headings with hashmarks or embedding links is straight-forward too. John Gruber invented Markdown in 2004 and the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">original spec</a> is still a great description of the language.</p>

<p>I use Markdown for tons of stuff.  This includes the notes that go along with every one of my lectures and presentations.  I can write them quickly and then have them display nicely on my iPad while I talk and walk around the room. I also take all my meeting notes in Markdown and sometimes share them with other meeting attendees. I write all my blog posts in Markdown and let Octopress/Jekyll automatically turn them into pretty HTML.</p>

<p>I don’t (yet) use Markdown for everything.  My research articles are mostly written in Latex which does a much better job with mathematical equations and big structured documents.  I use MS Word when I am collaborating with someone who is more comfortable in that environment. My class syllabi are still in Latex, but even though I could probably switch, it might be more trouble than it’s worth.  And while I often draft my slide content in Markdown, it almost always ends up in a set of PowerPoint slides where I have much greater control over the layout.</p>

<p>On the Mac, I use <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">emacs</a>  and <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a> to edit standalone Markdown files like blog posts and lecture notes.  I like emacs because I’ve been using it for 20 years and it’s really an extension of my brain at this point. It’s also what I use for editing code.  On the other hand, it’s kind of ugly.  FoldingText lets me hide/show sections of my document easily and makes my documents look pretty while I edit them by doing things like bolding text surrounded by double stars and hiding the actual double stars unless my cursor is on the bolded words.  It does the same sort of thing for links.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> on my Mac to edit and manage all my meeting notes and miscellaneous notes. When editing, it just shows the raw text, but I can always hold down the control key to see the pretty version of the text.  nvAlt is super-easy to search and it stores all the notes as separate files on dropbox so I can easily migrate to some other app if the mood strikes.</p>

<p>On my iPhone, I use <a href="http://writeup.prasannag.com">WriteUp</a> to edit standalone files like this blog post right now since it syncs so easily with Dropbox.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notesy-for-dropbox/id386095500?mt=8">Notesy</a> syncs perfectly with nvAlt on the Mac.  On the iPad, Writeup displays my lecture notes beautifully and gives me the option to make last minute edits.</p>

<p>If this post piques your interest, there’s great info about Markdown all over the web. Perhaps the single best resource is a <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">new book</a> by David Sparks and Eddie Smith that gathers a whole bunch of Markdown info in one place.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Exams and Online Classes]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/23/exams-and-online-classes/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/08/23/exams-and-online-classes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With just a few exceptions, no one likes exams.  Students don’t like the stress of taking the exams, instructors have to write the exams, and someone usually has to grade them. In-class exams don’t give enough time for testing very much material, and if the test is too long, it punishes students who know their stuff but are just a little slow. Take-home exams can cover more content, but it can be very tempting for students to cheat by getting help from friends or the Internet. Unfortunately, we need objective assessments of how much each student has mastered the course material, and right now exams are the best tool we have.</p>

<p>In an online class, exams are even trickier.  In my econometrics class this summer, we held our midterm and final exams in the virtual classroom.  At exam time, I emailed them a PDF with all the questions and my students wrote their answers on paper while my teaching assistant and I watched them through their webcams. We used pencil and paper because answering the questions required doing a fair amount of math and I wanted to see their work.  I didn’t want them to use valuable time slowly typing in symbols and equations. After two hours, they scanned their written answers (mostly with their phone cameras) and emailed them to me.  When I confirmed receipt and readability, the students were free to go.  </p>

<p>The process was easy and convenient, but had one major flaw: it would have been pretty easy to cheat. I say this believing in my heart that none of my students cheated and having absolutely no evidence to even make me suspicious.  Even so, any one of them could have forwarded the exam PDF to a friend (or professional) and had them email back their answers.  The incentives for doing so are actually quite strong: Yale classes are not cheap and they get real Yale credit for my online class. Not to mention the fact that most elite college students care a lot about their GPA.</p>

<p>A second problem we ran into was that students’ Internet connections were not always reliable.  When these connections dropped, some students didn’t even notice for a while and others had trouble reconnecting.  It wouldn’t have been fair to just disqualify those students, but again, it was a pretty huge opportunity to cheat. </p>

<p>We considered three alternative testing procedures, but I think only one would be a clear improvement over what we did.  First, we thought about requiring students to have a separate webcam that would let us view their computer screen.  In this scenario, they couldn’t use their computer for evil, but I still think it would be relatively easy for them to cheat with an alternative device outside the frame of view.  Second, we investigated using an online service that locks down their computer for only exam taking purposes. <a href="https://webassessor.com">Webassessor</a> provides this service along with online proctors, but it would also require good webcam placement.  And both of these alternatives are still reliant on continuous connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>The solution I like best is to use an in-person testing service where students go to a controlled physical location to take their exam.  <a href="https://www.prometric.com">Prometric</a> has more than 10,000 test taking centers all over the world–that means a huge fraction of the world’s population is within two hours drive of a center so it’s not all that inconvenient to travel to one one or two times during a course.</p>

<p>Timing is an issue for all these solutions–that is, you’d like all your students to take the exam simultaneously so the early students can’t share information with those that take the exam later.  If your students are scattered around the globe, at least some of them will have to take their exam in the middle of the night and that doesn’t seem fair.  My students in the far east had to take their exams at either 10pm or 11pm.  One way around this problem would be to have two versions of the exam–one for each half of the planet.</p>

<p>Next time I teach an online class where the stakes are high, I’m going to try to use a service like Prometric.  I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/07/24/opposite-of-a-mooc/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/07/24/opposite-of-a-mooc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MOOC’s are Massive Open Online Courses and they are what everyone in higher education is talking about. These classes  are usually free, have huge enrollments, and per student are pretty cheap to run relative to a typical college class. The quality can be decent and MOOC’s open up access to higher education to literally billions of people around the world. MOOC’s also have the potential to decrease the cost of education for the millions of people that would normally attend a traditional in person college.</p>

<p>Yale currently allows anyone on the Internet to watch record lectures from many of its best classes through <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu">Yale Open Courses</a>, but with zero interactivity, the user experience is quite different from taking a “real” course.  Yale has also recently entered a relationship with Coursera, the leading MOOC provider, and plans to dip its foot in the MOOC pool this year with a few classes.</p>

<p>At the same time, Yale has been breaking new ground through its Summer Session online classes which aim to let students experience as close to an in-person class as you can get without being on campus. These classes mix recorded video lectures with the usual outside-class reading and problem sets and a live interactive video session with the professor and rest of the class.</p>

<p>It’s these live sessions that are really innovative for online learning.  When a student logs in, they see everyone else in the class including the professor in a virtual classroom.  Imagine a Google Hangout with up to 25 participants.  It requires everyone to have a decent internet connection, but when it works, it’s kind of amazing. </p>

<p>It would be impossible to scale up this type of course to “massive” numbers of students, but the idea is to maximize quality, not minimize price.  I call it a Small Closed Online Course, and while Yale started offering these online classes two summers ago, I’m in the middle of teaching my first one now.  It’s “Econometrics and Data Analysis” and it’s been a real learning experience for everyone so far.</p>

<p>Students can take the class from almost anywhere.  I have students logging in three times a week from China, Singapore, Madrid, Kentucky, Alberta, California, and even a couple from downtown New Haven, CT. They can watch the video lectures when it is convenient for them and they have the power to pause and replay parts that are not clear the first time through.</p>

<p>The live experience is a work in progress. I use it to do three substantive things.  First, I answer questions about the recorded material and the reading.  It seems clear that my students are not taking notes and writing down questions they cannot ask in the moment (as they would in an in-person class) because most days they don’t have any questions. It’s hard to know how if they are really engaging with the recorded lectures or if they have them on while they’re doing something else. For the past couple classes I’ve been asking them basic questions about the material to get a sense for how much is sinking in. I am thinking about requiring them to email questions before the live session begins.</p>

<p>The main thing I do in the live sessions is have my students work through problems together.  The software we are using (<a href="http://watchitoo.com">Watchitoo</a>) allows me to divide the class into groups and send them to sub-classrooms.  I visit each of the groups in turn and push them along when they get stuck. It’s classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipped classroom</a> stuff and it works well.</p>

<p>The third thing we do is discuss the material. I haven’t done much of this so far, but I have some future classes planned where we go over new applications of methods and talk in depth about specific points.  Most of Yale’s online classes thus far have been discussion-oriented (e.g., psychology or philosophy), but econometrics is much closer to a math class and thus not as good a match for discussions.</p>

<p>The technology has mostly worked well but has some real rough edges. Some students just don’t have strong enough internet connections and drop in and out during the live sessions. Moving between the sub-classrooms and the full classroom takes several more mouse clicks and time than I’d like. The whiteboard built into the live session software is too buggy to use, but we’ve had great success with a free HTML-based shared whiteboard (<a href="http://awwapp.com">awwapp.com</a>) I have the live session in one window on my laptop and my whiteboard in another window on my Wacom external monitor.  This lets me write with a real stylus and still see all my students.</p>

<p>One of the most successful parts of the class is my office hours.  I hold them in the same virtual classroom and use the same virtual whiteboard.  It’s almost identical to my in-person office hours.  Realtime access to an expert is the biggest difference between this class and a MOOC.</p>

<p>I’m getting a fair bit of feedback on how much they’re learning from their problem sets and the live sessions, but I miss being able to look into their eyes while I’m lecturing. We have our first exam this week, and I honestly don’t know how they are going to do.  My fingers are crossed.</p>
