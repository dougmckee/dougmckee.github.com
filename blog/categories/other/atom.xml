    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/02/13/my-second-blogoversary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past few weeks this blog has achieved two big milestones: December 21 marked the second anniversary of <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2011/12/21/first-post/">my first post</a>, and on December 30, I published my 100th article. To mark the occasion, I thought it would be fun to reflect on the past two years quantitatively.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/22/happy-blogoversary/">2012</a>, I published 54 articles with 29,699 words, and in 2013, I posted 44 articles with 27,938 words–a decline, but not a major one. The average length of an article went up (550 words vs. 635 words) as did the standard deviation of the word count per article (296 words vs. 394 words). The increasing variance on this dimension can be seen visually in these two overlaid histograms:</p>

<p><img src="/images/analyze-2014-02-09/wchist.png"></p>

<p>So is this blog high variance in article length? That’s hard to say without scraping a bunch of other blogs and analyzing the data. <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/how-i-write/">Matt Gemmell</a> says the distribution of his article lengths is bimodal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I’m not writing to a count, I have two natural lengths of piece:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>700 to 1,000 words for a compact exposition on a topic. This is also an ideal bite-sized chunk of text for the reader, and fits well on a single page. It’s no coincidence that the majority of commissioned magazine pieces fall into this band.</li>
    <li>2,000 to 3,500 words for a more detailed exploration or discussion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The zone between the two is a death march.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I seem to have one natural length, but its range is a bit broader than Matt’s shorter pieces, as only half my articles fall within 369 and 724 words. If you include Matt’s longer pieces, he clearly wears the higher variance crown.</p>

<p>The yearly numbers mask an interesting monthly pattern. While I wrote a little less in 2013, I was more consistent in my output during the year. In both years I started strong, gradually slowed down, and then picked up the pace again in the fall:</p>

<p><img src="/images/analyze-2014-02-09/ac.png">
<img src="/images/analyze-2014-02-09/wc.png"></p>

<p>Most article content seems to have settled into a small set of categories (<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/tech/">tech</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/kids/">kids</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/education/">education</a>, and <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/music/">music</a>. You could even make an argument that you’re reading a mixture of four distinct extremely low-traffic blogs with the occasional off-the-wall post thrown in. The below picture shows article counts by tag for each year for each tag that had more than one article. Many articles are tagged more than one way and every article I’ve published had at least one of the tags shown below. I wrote a bit more about education and Conan in 2013 and a bit less about music, but I’m not sure those trends will continue in 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/images/analyze-2014-02-09/tags.png"></p>

<p>On the demand side, High Variance had 8,504 unique visitors in 2013 (up from 2,017) and 13,809 page views (up from 4,000). Chris Blattmann <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2013/04/18/links-i-liked-220/">pointed his firehose my way</a> in mid-April, but even if I ignore that week (961 unique visitors and 1,578 page views), readership is still way up for the year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/analyze-2014-02-09/traffic-2013.png"></p>

<p>To celebrate, I’ve made a few minor tweeks to the site. First, I’ve added an <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> rule that tweets every time I post something new. You can follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=HighVarianceNet">HighVarianceNet</a>. Second, I’ve made it easier to share content on the site by adding links for tweeting articles and sharing them on Facebook. Third, I’ve signed up as an <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/main.html">Amazon associate</a>. That means if you follow a link from this site to Amazon and then buy the product, you’ll pay the same price but I’ll get a few cents. Maybe by the end of next year I’ll be able to celebrate with a free cup of coffee.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-conan-the-snowman.jpg"></p>

<p>Conan the Snowman, was a fierce barbaric soul,<br />
With a sword of steel and a battle cry, total victory was his goal.  </p>

<p>Conan the Snowman, is a fantasy, they say.<br />
He was from far North, but the children know, he raided their village one day.  </p>

<p>There must have been some anger in that well-worn blade he held,<br />
For when he swung it round his head, his enemies they were felled.    </p>

<p>Oh, Conan, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;<br />
and the children say he could laugh and slay,<br />
any man and his family.  </p>

<p>Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,<br />
look at their heads roll. </p>

<p>Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,<br />
vanquishing his foe.  </p>

<p>Conan the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,<br />
so he said, “Let’s fight, all day and all night, until rain washes the blood away.”</p>

<p>Raging through the village, with his deadly sword in hand,<br />
Running here and there, all around the square,
sayin’, “Kill me if you can.”</p>

<p>Then he wandered east to a fearsome beast and met it eye to eye.<br />
and only paused a moment, when we heard him scream out, “Die!”  </p>

<p>For Conan, the Snowman, made all his enemies pay,<br />
But he waved goodbye, sayin’ “You better cry,<br />
I’ll be back again some day.”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I dreamt I was at my high school reunion. Near the end of dinner, one of the organizers came to my table and asked if everyone who was gay would raise their hand because they were planning a separate meeting just for gay alumni. Six attendees from our table of 26 raised their hands. I had no idea about five of them, and while my first reaction was surprise, my second was pride in the social change that’s happened over the last 25 years.</p>

<p>In just the last year, we’ve had the first male American athlete in a major sport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Collins">Jason Collins</a>) come out with near universal acceptance. The number one draft pick in the WNBA draft (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner">Britney Griner</a>) mentioned she was gay and hardly anyone noticed. The Supreme Court seems on the verge of legalizing gay marriage (or at least banning the states from banning gay marriage).  And my (almost) alma mater<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Framingham High School, now has a club called the <a href="http://www.framingham.k12.ma.us/fhs_alliance.cfm">Gay/Straight Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>The reunion and the casual statements about sexual orientation by my old friends may have been a dream, but the reality is much better. Some of the healthiest and most loving couples I know are gay. Some of the best parents I know are gay. And it’s so nice that this is finally being recognized by a majority of Americans.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I actually attended Framingham South High School, but in 1991 it merged with Framingham North High School to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_High_School">Framingham High School</a>.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <updated>2013-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/04/25/feeling-negative</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of time on this blog raving about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/04/11/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-3/">great kid books</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/02/22/not-dead-yet/">great music</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/01/17/mincer-1958/">great writing for grown ups</a>, and even <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/01/08/an-homage-to-chris-welty/">great teaching</a>, but don’t get the idea that I think everything is all sunshine and roses. There are plenty of things I don’t appreciate. Here are just three:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-grateful-dead.jpg" title="[title “Maybe the Ugliest Shirt of All-Time”]" ></p>

<h2 id="the-grateful-dead">1. The Grateful Dead</h2>

<p>When I think of the Dead, the first things that come to mind are dirty feet, ugly tie-dyed shirts, drugs, and silly annoying songs that just go on and on and on.  If you’re into that sort of thing, then I’m really sorry you can’t follow them around anymore.  At least you’ve got Phish.</p>

<h2 id="ezra-jack-keats">2. Ezra Jack Keats</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-willie.jpg" title="[title “Whistle for Willie”]" ></p>

<p>This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Jack_Keats">Ezra Jack Keats</a> week at my girls’ preschool and besides <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/">Eric Carle</a>, there isn’t a more over-rated children’s book author/illustator.  I’m not an expert on Jack Keats, but I have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Snowy-Day-Board-Book/dp/0670867330">The Snowy Day</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whistle-Willie-Board-Book-Keats/dp/0670880469">Whistle for Willie</a> and thus feel perfectly justified generalizing to his whole body of work. I like that he his stories take place in cities. I like that he’s got African-American characters. And I’m not arguing he wasn’t an important trail blazer–he was. I’m just arguing that the books themselves are uninspired and boring.  In the last forty years lots of authors have taken the torch and done a better job with it. My favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rain-Stomper-Addie-Boswell/dp/0761453938">The Rain Stomper</a> (by Boswell Addie, illustrated by Eric Velasquez), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a> (by Don Freeman), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bear-Bike-Stella-Blackstone/dp/1905236980">Bear on a Bike</a> (by Stella Blackstone, illustrated by Debbie Harter)</p>

<h2 id="new-orleans">3. New Orleans</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-voodoo.jpg" title="[title “VOODOO”]" ></p>

<p>For some people, New Orleans is a great city. It’s got world class sea food and its own brand of jazz. It’s got a casino downtown and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street">whole street</a> full of daiquiris and debauchery. But for a vegetarian who doesn’t drink, doesn’t gamble, and whose musical tastes are a little less hip, New Orleans doesn’t have much to offer. I used to think the best thing about the city was voodoo and while that sounds all cool and mysterious, when you take a closer look, it’s not. Chicken blood, bits of hair, and stabbing little dolls to hurt real people is just creepy. Of course, there is <a href="http://www.auduboninstitute.org/visit/insectarium">the Insectarium</a> which is also a little creepy, but was a lot of fun with the girls when we visited a couple weeks ago. </p>

<p>OK, I’ll admit it: I’m not usually such a Debby Downer, but  accumulated sleep debt from a busy winter and spring has taken a toll on my normally sunny disposition. Hopefully the end of the semester will take care of this I’ll soon be back to being a Cheerful Charlie!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/03/09/dishes/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/conan-dishes/yorkies.jpg" alt="Yorkies!" /></p>

<p>Limited edition dishes have a very limited market for two main reasons. First, they feature a very limited selection of art. Cute dogs, American flags, flowers, and Russian folk tales only appeal to so many people.  These plates are basically baseball cards for grandmas. Second, most of these dishes are designed solely for display and could actually kill you if you ate off them–this is crazy since the last time I checked normal people used dishes for serving food, not decorating their walls.  These companies need to expand their stables of artists and use nontoxic paints. </p>

<p>To get things started concretely, I propose the following set of four limited edition dinner plates by Frank Frazetta.  Imagine the look of wonder on your guests’ faces as they clear their plates and reveal the raw ferocity and masculinity of Conan the Barbarian. I know I would buy them. Click through to see them in their full resolution glory!</p>
