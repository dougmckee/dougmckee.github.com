    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two of my favorite bloggers (<a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="http://brooksreview.net">Ben Brooks</a>) recently
published passionate <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/05/06/bathroom-fan-timer-switches">love</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/amazon-item/">letters</a> to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TJAGPS">Panasonic WhisperCeiling</a> bathroom
fan, and in Marco’s case, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00313JXB0">Leviton electronic timer switch</a>.  Since
our downstairs bathroom has had no fan at all for more than a year, and
our upstairs bathroom fan sounded like a jet engine (and took 20 minutes
to de-fog a mirror), I took this as a sign that it was time to upgrade.
It was harder than expected to find an electrician to install them, but
today was the big day.  It’s worked out pretty well for our upstairs
bathroom, but not so much for the downstairs bathroom.  In fact, I was
surprised by three issues that were unmentioned in the “reviews” I read:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Panasonic WhisperLite fan/light combo unit is approximately
square and it doesn’t fit in our downstairs bathroom because we have a
cast-iron drain pipe running 8.5” away from the stud where the fan has
to be mounted.  Drat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulbs in the WhisperLite are compact-fluorescent and they send
out a very white light.  I like it, but my wife calls it “institutional”
and she says it reminds her of a public restroom.  This isn’t exactly
where anyone wants to be taking a shower, and if she doesn’t acclimate, I’m
hoping we can just change the bulbs to something a little softer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leviton switch requires three wires (including a neutral) and our
downstairs bathroom only has two.  If I want a timer switch we either
spend $200 to run a new line (I’m not <em>that</em> crazy) or we get one of
those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intermatic-FD15MWC-15-Minute-Spring-Loaded/dp/B000EVS4WG">spring-loaded knobs</a> that screams hotel sauna.  For now, we’re
sticking with the old manual switch.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To be fair, the new fan is very quiet and is working like a champ–our
upstairs bathroom isn’t small and during a leisurely shower the mirror
never fogged up.  And the Leviton timer is far more reliable than I was
about remembering to turn off the fan when it’s done its job.  But I
think there is a bigger lesson here: Some products that are perfect for
some people (or bathrooms) are not perfect for others, and we shouldn’t
let ourselves be blinded by the opinions of fan-bois.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/11/tire-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I went to <a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com/">a local shop</a> and
bought new tires for the mountain bike I ride around town almost every
day.  The angst I felt while deciding exactly what to buy took me by
surprise.  Part of me wanted something cheap and durable that would roll
smoothly and efficiently on pavement. But another part of me wanted to
replace my worn out racing tires with something aggressive, knobby and
impractical for city streets.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenties and thirties the bike I rode defined me more
than my sunglasses, my haircut, or my car. It was more than my
style—it was a major part of my identity. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but imagine what a truck guy’s truck means to him or what an
Apple nerd’s Mac means to him (or her).  A good friend of mine would
call me regularly and say “Got time for some tire talk?”  We would spend
the next half hour dissecting the pros and cons of different treads;
analyzing the tracks we saw out on the trails; debating whether Kevlar
worth the price premium; discussing trends like “thin on the bottom,
knobby on the sides”, and arguing about what tire shed mud or carved
corners best.  At the end though, the most important question was: “What
are you riding right now?”</p>

<p>Since I hit my forties my life has changed a lot.  I spend the vast
majority of my time working, parenting, or doing house stuff.  Trail
riding (and even trail-running) is mostly on hiatus.  My daylight
leisure time is almost always having fun with the girls and when they’re
sleeping at night I’d rather blog than ride.  In a few years (when the girls are
older) I’m sure I’ll be back, but until then, my riding will be limited
to the streets between my offices and classrooms.  This is far far
better than nothing–I actually love battling traffic and the elements.</p>

<p>So it’s been years since my bike’s gotten dirty, but up until last week,
I still had the option of veering onto any trail and cutting through East
Rock Park at a moment’s notice.  And I liked projecting the image of an
MTB guy on his way to a trailhead (even if I was wearing a corduroy
jacket).  Those days are over.  I chose a pair of
<a href="http://www.kendausa.com/en/home/bicycle/commuter.aspx">cheap tires</a>
that ride way better than my old knobbies on the road.  They even
have a little bit of a tread that could handle some of the East Rock
trails.  But now I’m honest with myself and world.  I’m a bike commuter.
It’s not permanent, but it’s true.  And I’m good with that.</p>

    <id>http://www.highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/01/why-are-zebras-so-mean-and-horses-so-nice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Jared Diamond’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552">Guns Germs and Steel</a>,
he asserts that zebras cause more injuries to zoo keepers than any other
animal. At least that’s how I remember it–I gave my copy away years ago
and never replaced it. In any event, it’s common knowledge that <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Woman-bitten-by-Zebra.jpg">zebras are mean</a> and you can’t really tame them. Horses on the other hand are
every little girl’s best friend and they are happy to wear <a href="http://michellewrighton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dsc_4039.jpg">garlands of flowers</a> and <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2659658105_d8bccd69f1.jpg">nibble apples out of your hand</a>.  Why such a difference when
on the surface zebras just seem like striped horses?</p>

<p>Before I go any further I should say that the rest of this post is a
pure mixture of Wikipedia and armchair theorizing. You have been warned.</p>

<p>The answer has to be geography. The savanna is a
<a href="http://babeinthebush.blogspot.com/2009/08/luangwa-battlefield-of-hippo-part-5.html">tough place</a>. It’s
got cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs (that also make <a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/animalsnature/african-wild-dogs/">terrible pets</a>),
crocodiles (near the water anyway) and of course lions. Friendly and
laid back on the savanna equals dead. You have to be fierce
(zebras/meerkats), big (elephants/hippos/rhinos/giraffes) or fast and
high strung (impalas and ostriches) to survive.  But what about those friendly
monkeys that like to sit on shoulders in the bazaar?  Don’t they live on
the savanna? Well they can watch the action from the tops of trees and
eat their bananas in peace.  Zebras don’t have that option.</p>

<p>The temperate grasslands where horses evolved are a whole different
story. A lot more empty space and a lot fewer predators mean horses
could afford to just horse around all day before humans came along and
domesticated them.  Even the
<a href="http://www.fws.gov/rockymountainarsenal/kids/puzzles/PredatorsofthePrairie.pdf">temperate grassland predators</a>
are basically wild house pets. Wolves are genetically identical to dogs
and nothing else is big enough to give a horse more than a kick in the
shin.</p>

<p>Of course this very reasonable explanation doesn’t change the fact that
it’s grossly unfair that we can’t ride zebras around for fun–I mean
that would be so cool!  Maybe someday someone will splice nice genes
into the zebra (or striped genes into the horse) and I’ll get to live
the dream. Until then I’ll stick to the mountain bike for my riding
adventures. Oh well.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.highvariance.net/blog/2012/02/02/ode-to-my-messenger-bag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Messenger bags have been getting a lot of flack on
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/backpacks-my-bff/">Ben Brooks’ blog</a>
lately as he has made the complete switch to a
<a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0103">Tom Bihn Smart Alec backpack</a>.
He raves about the ergonomics and pockets and even makes a case that it
looks kinda cool.  Maybe this set up works for him, but I’m very happy
with my decidedly non-hipster plain vanilla blue and black
<a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/classic-messenger/1809057">Timbuk2 Classic Messenger</a>.</p>

<p>It’s almost all one cavernous compartment which gives me maximum
flexibility.  It’s is perfect for any combination of books, folders,
iPads, or my MacBook Air in it’s Zero Shock sleeve.  I leave the sleeve
unzipped so it’s easy to take the MBA in and out and if I don’t need it,
the whole sleeve/MBA combo stays home.  I love the simplicity of never
having to remember what’s in what pocket.  I’ve even used it to
transport pretty big boxes– they can stick out if need be and the flap
can partially cover them but be secured by the strap.</p>

<p>It’s super-fast to open and close since I don’t have to take it off my
back or loosen any straps.  I can keep my bike lock there when I’m out
and about and it’s trivial to pull it out and put it back in as needed.</p>

<p>It’s perfect for cycling–the weight is on your hips instead of your
back/shoulders and that makes for much better stability.  Just make sure
you use the strap that attaches to a belt loop so it doesn’t swing
around unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The ballistic nylon show almost no wear.  My bag is six years old and
I’ve put it through the laundry maybe three times.  And it’s not like I’ve
babied it–it’s with me outdoors every day rain, shine, or even the
arctic conditions of last winter in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The bottom line: Six years from now I’ll probably be using exactly the
same bag.  And it’ll still look great.</p>

    <link href="http://www.highvariance.net/blog/2012/01/14/radiators-thermostats-and-heat-momentum/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.highvariance.net/blog/2012/01/14/radiators-thermostats-and-heat-momentum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re deep into our first winter in the new house and are just now
figuring out how to properly control the indoor temperature.  On the
plus side, we’ve got the ingredients of a fabulous heating system.  The
brand-new
<a href="http://www.buderus.us/products/gasheating/gasconventionalboilers/loganog234x.html">gas-fired boiler</a>
is <em>so</em> much cheaper and cleaner than the oil-fueled relic that was here
when we moved in.  The house was built in the 1920’s and has one
or two huge radiators in every room.  We even have a
programmable thermostat (a Lux TX500B which is nearly identical to the
current <a href="http://www.luxproducts.com/thermostats/tx500e.php">Lux TX500E</a>)
so we can lower the temperature during the day when we’re at work and at
night when we’re in bed.</p>

<p>For the last couple months, the thermostat would turn on the boiler at
6:00 am and keep it on until the house reached 68 F.  The problem was
that even though the boiler turned off, the radiators were still full of
hot water and they would continue heating the house driving the
temperature up to 71 or 72 and driving me kind of crazy.  The same thing
would happen in the afternoon when we got home from work.</p>

<p>My first thought was that there must be a setting on the thermostat to
account for what I’m calling “radiator heat momentum”.  There isn’t.
The closest you can get is to lower the minimum amount of time the
boiler is on and that doesn’t actually help in most situations.  My
second thought was that this was a great excuse to get a
<a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest</a>–it’s the only thermostat anyone has ever
described as sexy, but as far as I can tell, its AI smarts are all about
saving you 10 minutes of programming.  This is especially true if you
have a pretty rigid schedule.  And it has no special knowledge of
radiators.  Oh well.</p>

<p>The solution we’ve settled on is imperfect, but  good and easy to
implement with some semi-creative thermostat programming.</p>

<p>WEEKDAYS: In the morning, we simply set the thermostat to go to 66 and
the temperature drifts up to where we want it after the boiler turns
off.  During the day, the house goes down to 62 and at 4:30 pm, the
thermostat goes back to 67.  The temperature drifts up a little higher
than we’d like, but we don’t want it to drop below 67 before we go to
bed and we can only have 4 different temperature settings per day. (Yes,
I think this restriction is ridiculous.)</p>

<p>WEEKENDS: At 6:00 am, the thermostat jumps to 66 and drifts up to about
68 within the hour.  At 7:00 am, the thermostat goes to 68 and that
keeps the house from getting too cold during the day when we are around.  We also set the
Swing on the thermostat to 0.25 degrees; this means the boiler turns on
fairly often for short periods of time but these little firings during the
day don’t generate much momentum–it’s really just the big push in the
morning and in the afternoon during the week that cause a problem.  It’s
possible we could raise the Swing and be a little more efficient and
still not generate much heat momentum.</p>

<p>I’m don’t know why other folks aren’t complaining about this (since
radiator heat isn’t <em>that</em> rare) and why the thermostats don’t handle it
more transparently.  My best guess is that less than mammoth radiators
don’t hold their heat as well and so it’s just not an issue in houses
with average radiators.  Either that or the solution I’ve come up with
is so obvious that no one feels the need to talk about it.  My ego tells
me it’s the former so I’m going with that.</p>
