    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There have been times in my life when I've listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I'm pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get---that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don't feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I've started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I'm as surprised as you are as I've always been an "I don't like
country" guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I'm not totally sure what's changed, but over the last few weeks
I've Shazamed several songs that I've had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">"Country Must Be Country Wide"</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it's so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80's.  It's got awesome guitar and great lines like
"In every state there's a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon".</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">"Got My Country On"</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is "Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars".  He
even says he's "Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac".</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">"This"</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn't be more earnest: "Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this."  I've never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">"Drink On It"</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It's about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Maybe this will country thing be a fad for me.  Or maybe I'll be wearing Wranglers and
cowboy boots by this time next year.  I'll definitely pass on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/smokeless">Skoal</a> though.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dougmckee.github.com/blog/2012/02/06/albums</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm old. I grew up wandering around record stores trying to decide
whether to buy albums based on one or two songs I might have heard on
the radio, cover art, and what I knew about the band. These were big
decisions when I didn't have much money and cd's were $15-17 each.</p>

<p>Today's online music world couldn't be more different.  Kids these days
think about albums like they're rotary dial phones--they download gobs of
music for free (e.g., BitTorrent) or they just listen to whatever they
want through Pandora or Spotify.  And when they do actually shell out cash,
it's 99 cents per song.</p>

<p>But I live in the past and still agonize over album purchases.  Prices have
gone down and my income has gone up a little, but I like owning my
music legally and I still like listening to the set of songs an artist
chose to package together as an album.  Over time though, I've developed
a few rules to guide me in the decision process.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn from previous purchases if the band produces albums with a few
good tracks and filler.  Madonna and Metallica both produce tremendous
quality throughout while Katy Perry is more up and down.  The younger
the artist, the more careful you have to be (Yes I'm looking at you
Justin Bieber!)</p></li>
<li><p>"Best of" albums can be a treasure trove (e.g., Electric Light
Orchestra or Heart) if original album quality is spotty.</p></li>
<li><p>Beware of bargains--it's those dreaded filler albums that are
most often on sale.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can restrain yourself from the impulse purchase, listen to the
album a couple times through on Spotify first.  A minute and a half
sample often isn't enough.</p></li>
<li><p>iTunes has deluxe versions of many albums that contain remixes and
the occasional music video.  With YouTube, the video's not much of a
draw, but I never regret the remixes which are often better than the
original versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Just because it's a concept album doesn't you shouldn't. cherry pick
the best tracks. Judas Priest's <em>Nostradamus</em> just isn't that good even
though the second track ("Prophecy") rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>As bends enter the twilight of their careers, albums get worse and
worse even though they can still produce individually good
songs. Metallica and Depeche Mode are great examples. This is the bright
side of a great band breaking up mid-career like The Beatles, Led
Zeppelin, or The Smiths.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Bottom line: The album may be dying, but it's not dead yet.  At least
not in my little fantasy world.</p>

    <id>http://dougmckee.github.com/blog/2012/01/28/all-men-play-on-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre>
  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down again.
  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down.
 
           "All Men Play on 10" 
           <em>Manowar, Sign of the Hammer</em>, 1984
</pre>


<p>Songs that celebrate rock and roll are a dime a dozen.  I mean, I love
Joan Jett's "I Love Rock and Roll" and Ozzy Osbourne's "You Can't Kill
Rock and Roll" and even Huey Lewis' "Heart of Rock and
Roll" as much as anyone, but the idea is a little played out.</p>

<p>On the other hand, songs that literally <strong>demand</strong> to be played loud and
explicitly proclaim the band's love of loud music are tremendously
under-appreciated.  It's a much smaller genre, but I can (and do) listen
to these songs over and over.</p>

<p>Here's a list of my favorites (<a href="http://c.itunes.apple.com/us/imix/play-it-loud!/id497298702">Ping version</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>"All Men Play on 10" <em>Manowar</em></li>
<li>"Turn Up the Radio" <em>Autograph</em></li>
<li>"I Love It Loud" <em>Kiss</em></li>
<li>"Shout It Out Loud" <em>Kiss</em></li>
<li>"Louder than Hell" <em>Motley Crue</em></li>
<li>"We Like It Loud" <em>Rough Cutt</em></li>
<li>"Turn It Up" <em>Ted Nugent</em></li>
<li>"The Right to Rock" <em>Keel</em></li>
<li>"I Wanna Rock" <em>Twisted Sister</em></li>
</ol>


<p>The first track, "All Men Play on 10" by Manowar is not the most
popular, but definitely has the most testosterone.  Everyone has
probably heard "Turn Up the Radio" by Autograph as it got tons of
airplay during the eighties, but Kiss has to be the undisputed king of
the category with two contributions: "I Love It Loud" and "Shout it Out
Loud".  "Louder than Hell" from Motley Crue wasn't one of their hits,
but it's always been one of my favorites.  Rough Cutt's "We Like it
Loud" and Ted Nugent's "Turn It Up" are more obscure, but still
classics.</p>

<p>The last two songs on my list are honorable mentions because they're
really more straight up rock anthems than only tangentially suggest that
music shouldn't be turned down.  Keel's "The Right to Rock" says</p>

<pre>
  Don't let anyone tell you
  How to live your life
  We won't turn it off
  We won't turn it down
  'Cause it's our way of life
</pre>


<p>while Twisted Sister's "I Wanna Rock" says:</p>

<pre>
  Turn it down you say,
  Well all i got to say to you is 
  Time and time again i say, "no!"
  No! no, no, no, no, no!
</pre>


<p>I'm absolutely certain I've left out some important tracks.  So any
suggested additions will be much appreciated!</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>I asked for help on
<a href="http://www.classicrockforums.com/forum/f7/play-loud-19367/">Classic Rock Forums</a> and got some
great suggested additions:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Loud" <em>Sammy Hagar</em></li>
<li>"Shout" <em>Grand Prix</em></li>
<li>"Blow Your Speakers" <em>Manowar</em></li>
<li>"Loud and Clear" <em>Autograph</em></li>
<li>"Play It Loud" <em>Diamond Head</em></li>
<li>"Play It Loud" <em>Saxon</em></li>
</ol>


<p>I can't believe I forgot to include "Blow Your Speakers", but the other five tracks
are new to me.  Every one is worth a listen--cranked up all the way of
course!</p>
