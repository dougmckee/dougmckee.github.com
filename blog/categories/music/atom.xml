    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img /images/hv-shout-at-the-devil.jpg %}</p>

<p>Late at night, as I putter around the house folding laundry or washing dishes or putting away toys, I often listen to podcasts. Most are mainstream. For sports, I listen to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2864045">BS Report</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/grantland-nfl-podcast/id730254718?mt=2">Grantland NFL</a>; for tech stuff, I listen to <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>; and for real life, I like <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a> and <a href="http://dadsbeingdads.net">Dads Being Dads</a>.</p>

<p>My current favorite podcast, however, is not mainstream. The <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/">Requiem Metal Podcast</a> features two guys (Mark Rudolph and Jason Hundey) playing and talking about their favorite extreme metal. They started broadcasting in 2008 and have since produced 170 episodes. Every one stands on its own and I’ve had great fun digging into their back catalog to learn more about bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_(band)">Emperor</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_thrower">Bolt Thrower</a>.</p>

<p>In their lead up to episode 100, they profiled what they considered the 10 most “crucial” years in metal. These are years that had not just great album releases, but albums that had a big impact on the future of the whole heavy metal genre. Even though Mark and Jason were little kids in the 80’s, they definitely appreciate them in hindsight, and their top 10 includes 4 years from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_Decadence_81-91">decade</a>: 1984 (#5), 1985 (#10), 1988 (#9), and 1989 (#1).</p>

<p>I attended high school from 1982 to 1986 and listened to a tremendous amount of metal during that time. I started with hard rock, moved into glam/hair, expanded into classic metal, and loved exploring thrash and the beginnings of extreme metal. My friend Mike and I used to hang out at our local independent record store (Rockin’ Mania) and flip through whatever new (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal">Nü</a>) metal came in each week. If the cover looked interesting one of us (usually Mike) would buy it. That’s how we discovered Metallica’s <em>Ride the Lightning</em>, Mercyful Fate’s <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, and the amazing Best of Metal Blade compilation albums.</p>

<p>I know I’m biased because 1983 was a particularly crucial year in metal for me, but three very important albums in the history of metal did come out that year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Kill em all</em> (Metallica). This was the first album by the biggest metal band of all time. It’s not as good as their next two, but it’s one of the first pure thrash records and it rocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Shout at the Devil</em> (Motley Crüe) I still remember seeing the album cover in a mall with my mom and being simultaneously scared, repulsed and intrigued. The <a href="http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/motleycrue/shoutatthedevil.html#1">first song on the album</a> is a weird Satanic-ish sermon (that I can still quote verbatim) and the music is surprisingly heavy for people who think of the Crüe as that band who sang “Girls Girls Girls” and “Home Sweet Home”. For tons of kids like me, this album was a powerful gateway into the world of real metal. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Melissa</em> (Mercyful Fate) Many people have written about how influential this band was on the development of the black metal genre, and extreme metal in general, but on the podcast, Mark often disparages Mercyful Fate by calling them “goofy” or “circus metal”. I’m here to tell you it didn’t come off that way <strong>at all</strong> back in the day. When my friend Mike bought their second album (<em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>) on a whim, we were completely creeped out the first time he played it. We just didn’t know what to do with the blasphemous lyrics, shreiking vocals, and unbelievably catchy guitar work. I had a copy on cassette which I ended up listening to a few times and then throwing in the trash. Mike did the same thing with his album–it’s like we thought we were destined to burn in hell if we kept them. Now, a little older and wiser we can appreciate the music and laugh at the lyrics. <em>Melissa</em>, their first album, isn’t as good as <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, but you can’t have a second without a first.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After high school, I moved away from home and away from metal. When hair metal disappeared from the radio, I thought metal itself  had died. In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s I knew Nü Metal was a thing, but only dabbled a bit with bands like Korn, Disturbed, and even Linkin Park. Later in the 2000’s I learned that music called black metal and death metal existed, but extreme metal can be an acquired taste and I just wasn’t ready. Now, with Mark and Jason’s help, I’m really enjoying filling in the huge gaps in my metal education.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/04/black-metal-for-kids/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/04/black-metal-for-kids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Black metal is nasty stuff. Most of it revolves around Satanic imagery, shreiking vocals and guitars, incredibly fast “blast beat” drums, and spooky low fi production. Most bands hail from Scandinavia, and in the mid 90’s the nastiness reached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Satanic-Underground-Edition/dp/0922915946">particularly nasty level</a> as bands competed with each other to see who was the most evil by burning churches and murdering each other. And yet, I really appreciate the dark moodiness and musicality.</p>

<p>You can imagine my surprise when I found an honest-to-goodness Norwegian black metal band that is perfect for kids and adults. Now, whenever we get in the car, my two year old requests their music and proceeds to laugh and sing along! How did this happen? A confluence of two amazing things.</p>

<p>As I’ve already reported, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library/">my girls love the Rainbow Magic books</a>. While the heros are Kirsty, Rachel, and the fairies, the villains are Jack Frost and the goblins. Their home is an icy castle north of Fairy Land and they are frankly hilarious. The goblins call each other names, trip over each other, and are some of the least scary “monsters” you’ll ever meet. I remember in one book Rachel and Kirsty got their way by tickling the goblins.</p>

<p>The band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a> has been recording black metal since before their first full-length release: <em>Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism</em> in 1992. Their music is classic black metal, but many of their songs simply describe frigid mountains and the grumpy king who reigns over them. B’s favorite song is “Mountains of Might.” It starts with organ which B says is “carousel music” and contains vocals which she calls “a goblin talking:”</p>

<pre><code>The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
The winds are everblowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descend of the valley
Into the high impassable drifts
So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Forever standing here
These mountains northern face
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Icicled peeks as far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
</code></pre>

<p>The acoustic break in the middle is when “the goblins are dancing.” The whole album (<em>Blizzard Beasts</em>) is recorded with the vocals mixed extra loud so they don’t get lost. My favorite part is how Abbath (the lead singer) pronounces glaciers as “glaysseers”. The <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/antarctica-lyrics-immortal.html">lyrics of “Antarctica”</a> (from <em>Sons of Northern Darkness</em>) are similarly child-friendly and the music is similarly goblin-friendly.</p>

<p>The only downside to Immortal for kids is common to all heavy metal: the terribly inappropriate music videos. Immortal follows black metal tradition and performs in corpse paint while making lots of scary faces. They also seem to love weird spiked bondage gear. They look ridiculous and I try to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VBdAY8eA9w">their videos</a> too. It doesn’t have to be this way. Consider the video below to be my small contribution to making the world a better place:</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/01/19/complementarities-of-literature-and-music</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some things just go well together. I have friends who like to select <a href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/wine-with-fish-pairing-guide/">just the right wine</a> to go with their meal. Cookies always taste better with <a href="http://www.gotmilk.com">milk</a>. And of course a PB&amp;J sandwich is much better than a plain peanut butter sandwich or a plain jam sandwich. Economists are good at coming up with fancy names for obvious concepts, and we call these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good">complementary goods</a>.</p>

<p>Just because I don’t listen to music while I read doesn’t mean this idea can’t be applied to literature and music. Some <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/category-songs_inspired_by_books.php">songs</a> or albums are inspired by good books, and listening to one makes you appreciate the other that much more. Even better is when a musician or band’s work creates a mood that perfectly matches an author’s vision. I’ve recently found the perfect example.</p>

<p>As regular readers of this site know, I am a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E_Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian">Conan</a> stories. Conan himself is strong, principled, and fun-loving. He does all the things we want to do but are unable to because of either physical, legal, or sometimes moral constraints. To read Conan’s savage adventures is to be immersed in a fantastic and vividly portrayed land of magic and mayhem.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon_Amarth">Amon Amarth</a> is the white wine to Conan’s fish. They are a Swedish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_death_metal">melodic death metal</a> band whose songs are rich and powerful tales of battles between mortals and gods of the north. The drums, guitars, and vocals are fierce–just like Conan. Listening to their music on headphones is the perfect way to make a winter trip to the grocery store into an epic quest for sustenance. The fact is that words cannot do them justice. I hereby present to you the truly awesome Amon Amarth: </p>

<!--- Amon Amarth, "Twilight of the Thunder God"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/12/the_year_in_apple_and_technology">John Gruber</a> loves to talk about how technology improves primarily through a series of small steps and the occasional big jump. While the first iPhone was revolutionary, the iPhone 5s is a far better product due to several incremental improvements, none of which got much attention along the way. In the last year, three small things changed in my home music system that make it better than <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/02/16/home-music-streaming-2/">the last time I wrote about it</a> and a <strong>lot</strong> better than when I <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/02/home-music-streaming/">first wrote about it</a>.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-itunes-radio.jpeg %}</p>

<h2 id="itunes-radio">1. iTunes Radio</h2>

<p>Right after releasing iOS 7, Apple updated it’s Remote app to 4.0. This is the app that lets you control iTunes on your computer from your phone. The main changes to the app were to the user interface–it became “lighter,” with thin fonts and textual buttons, and allowed you to move backwards by grabbing the left side of the screen and swiping. Feature-wise, it wasn’t much different from the previous version. This drove me crazy because iTunes Radio had just been launched and the new Remote app had not yet added support for it.</p>

<p>When iTunes Radio was just a rumor, I wasn’t very interested as it seemed like it would be a simple clone of Pandora. The strange thing is that it <strong>did</strong> turn out to be a straight-forward clone of <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>, but I listened to it much more than I ever listened to Pandora. The integration with the iTunes Store is really nice. iTunes Radio keeps track of all the songs I’ve ever listened to, and with one click I can see a song in the iTunes Store, check out the whole album, and <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/02/06/albums/">maybe even buy it</a>. I also like the stations that are built in–tween pop is pretty good (for the kids, of course) and pop country is well curated too. </p>

<p>Like Pandora, I can pick any artist and iTunes will create a custom radio station for them. Since there’s no Metalcore station built-in, I made a station out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killswitch_Engage">Killswitch Engage</a>, the prototypical metalcore band. Unlike Pandora (as far as I can tell), iTunes Radio lets me “tune” the station to play more or less popular tracks by related artists by choosing “Hits,” “Variety,” or “Discovery” mode. And the pretty uncluttered UI in the iOS app is just what you would expect from Apple–definitely nicer than Pandora’s.</p>

<p>In early December, Apple released Remote 4.1 with support for iTunes Radio and now I can stream it all over the house. Remote won’t show my Radio listening history and it’s laggier than I’d like, but I still use it all the time.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-pioneer-a4.jpeg %}</p>

<h2 id="my-new-pioneer-a4">2. My new Pioneer A4</h2>

<p>Lots of folks are perfectly happy playing music on their iPhone and sending it to a nearby speaker with either Bluetooth or a dock. My Airplay-from-a-server set up has several advantages that in my mind outweigh the small amount of added complexity and expense.  Since my phone is only controlling the music and not playing it, it doesn’t use up any power or need to be close by when the music is playing. That means I can wander to the other side of the house with my phone in my pocket and the music doesn’t come crashing to a halt. The sound quality over Airplay is better than over Bluetooth, and I don’t have to store any big music files on my phone–my whole library just sits on the Mac in my office. </p>

<p>My favorite feature of the set up is being able to stream simultaneously to several speakers around the house, and this just got even better as I’ve added a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-XW-SMA4-K-Speaker-featuring-Wireless/dp/B00903HKXI">Pioneer A4 Airplay speaker</a> in the basement. The A4 got an amazingly <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-airplay-speaker/">positive review</a> in <a href="http://thewirecutter.com">the Wirecutter</a>, and was just $200, even though it sounds like it should cost much more. The set up instructions are horrific, but the set up itself was not so bad. I’m a little perplexed about why Pioneer would discontinue it without an obvious replacement product, but they did. If you have one or manage to get your hands on one, I highly recommend holding the input button down for 3 seconds to turn on Quick Start Mode. This changes the start up time from 35 seconds to under 5 seconds, and while they don’t tell you how much extra power it burns standing by, it’s definitely worth it.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/hv-airfoil.jpeg %}</p>

<h2 id="simplified-configuration-for-spotify">3. Simplified configuration for Spotify</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a> is the application on my Mac that grabs output from <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> and sends it to any Airplay destination(s) I choose in the house. When Apple released <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/">Mavericks</a>, the new power management features broke Airfoil. The latest version of Airfoil works around this and also bakes in support for remote control, so I don’t need to run a separate Airfoil helper application anymore. <a href="http://remoteless.no">Remoteless</a>, the iOS app for controlling Spotify on the Mac also released an update recently that supports Airfoil directly, so I no longer need a separate Airfoil remote app on my phone.  The only software programs I need now to play almost any album anywhere in the house are Spotify and Airfoil running on the Mac, and Remoteless on iOS.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/09/18/so-embarrassing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always valued a catchy beat over insightful lyrics and my favorite genres tend to reflect that. In other words, I listen to a lot of songs with dumb lyrics, so it means something that the other day I heard some <em>extra</em> dumb lyrics on the radio. </p>

<!--- Bonnie McKee, "American Girl"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://highvariance.net//www.youtube.com/embed/-Uh6VZF0R5U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lets take a closer look at Bonnie McKee’s “American Girl” line by line:</p>

<pre><code>I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking slurpees we mixed with alcohol
</code></pre>

<p>Either you’re underage and shouldn’t be mixing in alcohol or you’re of age and shouldn’t be drinking slurpees in the parking lot. I’m not sure which is worse. </p>

<pre><code>We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (whoa oh oh oh)
I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be getting in my way
</code></pre>

<p>This is as good as it gets–girl power!</p>

<pre><code>But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh)
</code></pre>

<p>I think she’s making a subtle sexual reference here. </p>

<pre><code>I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry
</code></pre>

<p>First off, not one of these four lines actually rhymes, and I don’t think she’s trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant_rhyme">emulate Emily Dickinson</a>. Second, you’re to old to be calling your mother mommy. And third, I think even Gandhi had to occasionally apologize.</p>

<pre><code>Chorus
Oh I'm an American girl
</code></pre>

<p>If the rest of the world thinks this girl is representative of the whole population of American girls, we are in deep trouble.</p>

<pre><code>Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all american girl (Whoa) I was raised by a television
</code></pre>

<p>I spent a good chunk of my childhood in front of a TV too, but I watched relatively wholesome fare like The Brady Bunch, Happy Days, and Gilligan’s Island. She must have been raised by Bridezilla, real Housewives of Beverly Hills and The Jersey Shore. </p>

<pre><code>Every day is a competition Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)
</code></pre>

<p>Oh no; another subtle sexual reference. I think she needs to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_in_Black#Track_listing">AC DC school</a></p>

<pre><code>I wanna see all the stars and everything in between
</code></pre>

<p>Unless she has a thing for dark matter, I have a feeling she’s talking about celebrities more than astronomy.</p>

<pre><code>I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
Cause It's a free country so baby we can do anything (Whoa)
</code></pre>

<p>We may be a free country, but we still have fairly strict laws banning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_trade">sale of organs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Chorus

You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...) Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night) You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...) Oh baby gonna go all night

Chorus
</code></pre>

<p>Every American should be embarrassed that this song exists. I was doubly embarrassed when I saw the “artist” was my namesake. And I’m triply embarrassed by how much I actually enjoy the song. It’s not as good as “Party in the USA” or “Call Me Maybe,” but it just makes me want to get up and dance whenever I hear it.  Maybe I should just stop talking before I embarrass myself further. </p>
