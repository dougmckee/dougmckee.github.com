    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/02/24/heavy-metal-for-kids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When most people think of heavy metal, the major themes that come to mind are death, evil, testosterone, violence, and maybe misogyny.  And sure, the vast majority of heavy metal is probably inappropriate for most kids. Especially little kids. But that doesn’t mean <strong>all</strong> metal is inappropriate. Some songs are downright kid-friendly and they’re a great way to inject some fresh blood into the typical parent’s rather limited musical repertoire.</p>

<p>Before I dive into my list of recommended tracks, you should know that there exists an actual just-for-kids metal band from Finland called <a href="http://www.hevisaurus.com">Hevisaurus</a> and they are awesome. They dress in dinosaur outfits and the videos are the good kind of crazy. Unfortunately, singing in Finnish is a deal breaker for me–my kids love fun lyrics and this music doesn’t sound all that different from traditional Scandinavian metal. We might as well be listening to early <a href="http://www.youtube.com/artist/dimmu-borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtasXTviObo">Opeth</a>.</p>

<p>My list comes in two parts. First are the songs that are actually family-friendly. The music isn’t too scary and the words don’t have any unacceptably rude surprises. And they rock.  Songs on the second list also rock and might seem OK for kids at first.  It’s just that some of the words might induce an awkward conversation (best case) or nightmares (worst case). </p>

<h3 id="part-1-the-best-of-the-best">Part 1: The best of the best</h3>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVThw0EE_Jo">Crazy Train</a> (Ozzy Osbourne):</strong></p>

<p>This song is almost perfect–Kids love trains and laughing, and so does Ozzy. If you ignore the fake blood and the bat-eating (and maybe the finger tattoos), Ozzy is just a silly old man–he reminds me a lot of Santa Claus without the hat or the beard. This song even has words John Lennon could have written:</p>

<pre>
    Maybe it's not too late
    To learn how to love
    And forget how to hate
</pre>

<p>(Full disclosure: This was my high school yearbook quote.)</p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFMD7Usflbg">Rock and Roll All Night</a> (Kiss):</strong></p>

<p>The make-up and the costumes are super-fun and the song’s extremely catchy. Some of the lyrics are a little suggestive, but not enough to make me uncomfortable:</p>

<pre>
    You show us everything you've got
    Baby, baby that's quite a lot
    And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
</pre>

<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2O69EO1QZc">Merry Go Round</a> (Mötley Crüe):</strong></p>

<p>This song is another slam dunk–carousels are on my older daughters’ list of the top five things in life along with ponies, princesses, fairies, and <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/06/violence-in-kids-books/">minotaurs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIB9Y4OFPs">Pour Some Sugar on Me</a> (Def Leppard):</strong></p>

<p>Kids love sugar and messes and this song has both. The band name also provides a good teachable moment about spelling–adults make mistakes too!</p>

<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2RKWJD5ops">Ice Cream Man</a> (Van Halen):</strong></p>

<p>It’s not the heaviest song in the world, but it does have an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo and who doesn’t like ice cream? The only issue is that this song is (surprise) not about ice cream at all, but the kids don’t have to know David Lee Roth is a drug-addled perv.</p>

<p><strong>6. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orbFLK8n35E">Kids Will Rock</a> (Rough Cutt):</strong></p>

<p>Not too many folks have heard of Rough Cutt–they were one of the hair metal bands that didn’t quite make it big in the 80’s though I’m not sure why. This song is about kids and even has a chorus of kids join in at the end!</p>

<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX0Fp-T6YTc">Raise Your Hands to Rock</a> (Mötley Crüe):</strong></p>

<p>Songs that demand specific actions are always a big hit and this one couldn’t be catchier.</p>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfRhU7IFPE">Jump</a> (Van Halen):</strong></p>

<p>Another movement song and this one might be even more fun to act out than the last.</p>

<p><strong>9. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjCBV6o_DSE">Stand up and Shout</a> (Dio):</strong></p>

<p>Standing up and shouting is fun, but this song is borderline too fast and heavy. Ronnie also mentions being “nailed to the wheel” in passing, but even though I’ve listened to this song hundreds of times, I never noticed until reading the lyrics five minutes ago.</p>

<p><strong>10. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxdmw4tJJ1Y">Rock You Like a Hurricane</a> (The Scorpions):</strong></p>

<p>We’ve been reading a ton of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-School-Bus-Inside-Hurricane/dp/0590446878">Magic Schoolbus</a> books lately and hurricanes are pretty cool.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-dont-quite-make-the-cut">Part 2: Don’t quite make the cut</h3>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMLwslRNThM">Bark at the Moon</a> (Ozzy):</strong></p>

<p>I wanted so much for this song to be okay mostly because I’ve played it for the girls in the past and they like it. Hopefully they haven’t listened too closely to the words which contain gems like:</p>

<pre>
    Years spent in torment
    Buried in a nameless grave 
    Now he has risen 
    Miracles would have to save 
    Those that the beast is looking for 
</pre>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3swBEBqBc">Givin the Dog a Bone</a> (AC DC):</strong></p>

<p>I love dogs and I’m OK with innuendo, but this song crosses the subtlety line right away:</p>

<pre>
    She take you down easy
    Going down to her knees
    Going down to the devil
    Down down at ninety degrees
    She blowing me crazy
    'til my ammunition is dry
    She's using her head again
    She's using her head
</pre>

<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogYGDdl2Zs4">Give It All</a> (Ratt):</strong></p>

<p>I thought I might be able to spin this song as a tune about putting in your best effort. Too bad Stephen Pearcy is actually talking about how much love he is going to give his partner that night.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a9DW_zhV84">Modern Day Cowboy</a> (Tesla):</strong></p>

<p>This song is about cowboys and it’s a story about the Cold War that even teaches lessons about geography and spelling with lines like “the USA! the USSR!” Unfortunately even cold wars involves guns:</p>

<pre>
    Bang Bang, shoot'em up.
    Bang Bang, blow you away.
</pre>

<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4zwAYiUybA">Hungry</a> (Winger):</strong></p>

<p>Kids get hungry and Winger is catchy as heck. But this song is not about being hungry for food:</p>

<pre>
    Girl I'm hungry for your love
    Girl I'm hungry
    Baby let me in
    Hungry for your love
    Hungry I can't get enough
</pre>

<p><strong>6.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGWjwnvHpY8">Don’t Talk to Strangers</a> (Dio):</strong></p>

<p>This song had such promise as a fun song that teaches a valuable lesson. Too bad Ronnie James Dio comes across as a paranoid psychotic:</p>

<pre>
    Don't talk to strangers
    Cause they're only there to do you harm
    Don't write in starlight
    'Cause the words may come out real
    Don't hide in doorways
    You may find the key that opens up your soul
    Don't go to Heaven cause it's really only Hell
    Don't smell the flowers
    They're an evil drug to make you loose your mind
    Don't dream of women
    'Cause they'll only bring you down
</pre>

<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MII3ns2KTBc">Iron Man</a> (Black Sabbath):</strong></p>

<p>The story of Iron Man is in many ways a like that of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. He looks different from everyone else and people mistreat him. And just as Rudolph led the sleigh on that foggy night, Iron Man “travelled time for the future of mankind.” But instead of joining in everyone’s reindeer games, Iron Man “kills the people he once saved.” Oh well.</p>

<h3 id="part-3-confession-time">Part 3: Confession time:</h3>

<p>I am a true child of 80’s metal and would very much like to share my passion for heavy music with my children. That’s why I’ve gone to the trouble to curate this list of songs that won’t get me fired as a dad. But a few issues remain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The girls don’t actually like these songs very much. I’m hoping they will grow on them, but for now they far prefer kid music, boy bands, girl-pop, and even Latin music and reggae. </li>
  <li>None of my recommended songs are all that heavy. Korn, Metallica, and Slayer are all conspicuously absent. I’m going to be listening to “real” metal on my own time until the girls are quite a bit older. </li>
  <li>I don’t suggest watching any of the video versions of these songs.  All the subtlety goes out the window and is usually replaced by pyrotechnics and half-naked women. </li>
  <li>Suppose the your kids love this play list. There isn’t really anywhere else kid-appropriate to go. It was surprisingly hard to come up with even these few songs. </li>
</ol>

<p>All that said, my girls do put up with it in small doses and I certainly enjoy it!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/02/16/home-music-streaming-2/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/02/16/home-music-streaming-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hv-music-apps.png" alt="music apps" title="The music row of my iPhone home screen" /></p>

<p>Our household is heavily invested in iTunes. We have a big collection on an iMac that never sleeps. We have an AppleTV in the living room and an Airport Express in the kitchen that serve as AirPlay destinations. With the iOS Remote app, we can stream whatever we want wherever we want. It doesn’t depend on Bluetooth or on keeping iPods synced up to date, and now that our wifi network is working well<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, <a href="/blog/2012/03/02/home-music-streaming/">it’s great</a>. But I wanted more. </p>

<p>It turns out that our current 13,585 songs is not enough. Pretty often I’ll hear a new “artist”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> on the radio and want to hear more from them. In the olden days I would carefully listen to 90 second samples in the iTMS and fret about <a href="/blog/2012/02/06/albums/">whether to invest in the whole album</a>. Now I can login to <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> on the desktop and listen to as much as I want over and over. If only there was a way to easily spread this goodness around the house. Of course there is.</p>

<p>The key to the system is a piece of Mac software made by <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com">Rogue Amoeba</a> called <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">AirFoil</a>. It costs $25 and it will push the audio output of any app to any Airplay destinations. The next piece of the puzzle is an iPhone app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reemote-for-airfoil/id396381723">Reemote</a> ($4.99) that remotely controls AirFoil. Another iPhone app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/remoteless-for-spotify/id353392482">Remoteless</a> ($2.99) lets me control the desktop Spotify and do things like search for artists, albums, or songs to play.  Each app requires a free helper app that runs on the Mac. If you’re willing to put up with Spotify’s ads (so far I am), the service is free! </p>

<p>Once Spotify, iTunes, and the two helper apps are up and running, here’s how it works. If I want to play music from my library, I bring up Reemote and make sure Airfoil streaming is turned off to my three destinations. Then I use Remote just as I used to. If I then want to play something with Spotify, I tell Remote to stream only to the computer and tell Reemote to stream to either the kitchen or the living room or both. Then I use Remoteless to get Spotify going. The process is surprisingly efficient when all three apps are on your iPhone’s home screen. The system itself is a little finicky and does occasionally require me to restart Spotify on the desktop, but the extra power is so worth it.</p>

    <updated>2012-12-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/13/playing-the-victim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The eighties are not known as a time of soul bearing honesty (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">Iran-Contra</a>), but
eighties music is full of cheesy earnestness about love in its various
messy forms.  Eighties singers told the hard truths even when it made
them look weak.  Here are four great examples of eighties guys who
weren’t afraid to play the victim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abYzI9ycjk">Everything She Wants</a> (by
Wham, 1984): George Michael is having a rough time with a no-good
money-grubbing girlfriend.  I smile every time he finds out
she’s pregnant and says “If my best isn’t good enough, how can it be
good enough for two?  I can’t work any harder than I do!” Maybe this was
the incident that turned him off women forever?  Not that there’s
anything wrong with that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu788foYCa8">I’ve Done Everything For You</a>
(Rick Springfield, 1981): Based on my analysis of his catalog, this
guy seems like he was just a bad boyfriend.  He lusted after his friend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs">Jessie’s girl</a>.  He told his girl not to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp42V938eBA">talk to strangers</a>.  And here
he says “I’ve done everything for you; you’ve done nothing for me!”
At least he was <a href="http://ztams.com/index.php?action=display&amp;ref=26342">good looking</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0">Don’t You Want Me?</a>(by
The Human League, 1981) This is another case of a guy who did
everything–“I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around”
and she’s got the nerve to dump him.  What’s unique in this song is that she
gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZW1C3neao">The Rain</a> (by Oran Juice
Jones, 1986): Here’s where we see that eighties male victimhood
crossed race lines.  The best part of the song is when we listen in on Mr. Jones
confronting his cheating girlfriend and telling her “You gotta get on
outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, punch-bucket-shoe-wearing
crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/06/03/unoriginal-ideas/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/06/03/unoriginal-ideas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of myself as a reasonably creative guy.  I’m not always coming
up with particularly useful or imporant ideas, but I like to think
they’re fairly unique.  Unique in a small town or among your friends is
one thing, but unique on the Internet is quite another.  I thought it
would be fun to share some ideas I had for posts that turned out be less
original than I first thought.</p>

<h2 id="is-height-normal">Is height normal?</h2>

<p>Adult height is one of the prototypical examples of a naturally
occurring normal distribution, but if you look at real data, it’s not
perfectly normal.  First off, it’s a mixture of men and women who
individually have pretty normal heights but quite different means (by
about 5”).  Second, the tails of the distribution are fatter than
normal.  That is, extremely short and tall people are far more common
than predicted by a pure normal distribution.  All this is explained
very nicely explained in two 2008 posts (<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-normally-distributed/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/11/25/distribution-of-adult-heights/">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-not-normally-distributed/">here</a>) by John D. Cook at <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">The Endeavor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nietzsche-and-pop-music">Nietzsche and pop music</h2>

<p>There aren’t very many 19th or 20th Century philosophers that inspire
pop songs. The Cure turned Albert Camus’ The Stranger into “Staring at
the Sea”, but up until a few weeks ago I thought that was it.  How wrong I
was!  Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I">What Doesn’t Kill You</a>” has been getting
tremendous airplay on pop stations and it’s not much different from
Christina Aguilera’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOJpIwF47Y">Fighter</a>” which also talks about how being
beaten down just makes her “stronger”, “harder”, and “wiser”.  And it
turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujhZoAg2-I">tons and tons of songs</a> have been inspired by this
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn159167.html">Nietzsche quote</a>.  I thought it would be fun to see how many more of
Nietzsche’s ideas (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#.C3.9Cbermensch">Superman</a>)  have been translated into pop
music (maybe “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan#Sunshine_Superman">Sunshine Superman</a>”?).  Turns out Craig
Schuftan has written a <a href="http://startnarrativehere.com/2010/01/hey-nietzsche-leave-them-kids-alone-the-romantic-movement-rock-roll-and-the-end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-by-craig-schuftan-2009">whole book</a> about this called
<em>Hey! Nietzsche! Leave Them Kids Alone!: The Romantic Movement, Rock &amp;
Roll, and the End of Civilisation as We Know It</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-impact-of-cleaning-the-augean-stables">The environmental impact of cleaning the Augean stables</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">The Fifth Labor of Heracles</a> was to clean the Augean stables.
They were so dirty and filthy that he had to divert two rivers through
them to wash out the manure that 1000 cattle had produced over thirty
years.  This reminded me of what happened when hurricanes hit North
Carolina a few years ago and pushed massive amounts of pig waste into
the water supply.  Wouldn’t it be interesting to write a quick
environmental impact statement for Hercules’ act?  A few people have
noticed that the effects were probably pretty serious (<a href="http://thepunnery.wordpress.com/tag/augean-stables/">The Punnery</a>,
<a href="http://hazwastemanagement.info/HazWasteManagement_Solutions/Chapter_16_HWM_2nd_ed_Solutions.pdf">this homework assignment</a> for a class on Hazardous Waste Management)
but no one has actually done any calculations to show how serious.
Hmm….maybe I can contribute something here!</p>

<h2 id="a-sitcom-about-a-woman-with-cancer">A sitcom about a woman with cancer.</h2>

<p>Last month I had a strange dream about developing a sitcom that starred
a woman who is diagnosed with cancer and goes through the whole
treatment process.  The story would have a full three year arc with
cliff-hangers every year when she (or her new best friend who also has
cancer) goes in for testing.  The final episode would be her saying
goodbye.  The show would have lots of funny kids, hair loss jokes, and
nausea jokes.  She could also start a romantic relationship in the
middle of the run.  An awfully large number of people have either had
cancer by now or had someone very close go through it.  I really believe
that a show like this would have a big audience of people who want to
laugh about a serious thing.  Showtime also believed this and started
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_C_(TV_series)">The Big C</a>” in 2010 and it’s entering its third season now.
According to Wikipedia, it’s been very successful since the beginning!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Got My Country On]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/20/country/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/20/country</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There have been times in my life when I’ve listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I’m pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get—that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don’t feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I’ve started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I’m as surprised as you are as I’ve always been an “I don’t like
country” guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I’m not totally sure what’s changed, but over the last few weeks
I’ve Shazamed several songs that I’ve had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">“Country Must Be Country Wide”</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it’s so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80’s.  It’s got awesome guitar and great lines like
“In every state there’s a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon”.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">“Got My Country On”</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is “Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars”.  He
even says he’s “Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">“This”</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn’t be more earnest: “Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this.”  I’ve never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">“Drink On It”</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It’s about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.  </p>
  </li>
