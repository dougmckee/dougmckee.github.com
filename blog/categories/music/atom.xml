    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The eighties are not known as a time of soul bearing honesty (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">Iran-Contra</a>), but
eighties music is full of cheesy earnestness about love in its various
messy forms.  Eighties singers told the hard truths even when it made
them look weak.  Here are four great examples of eighties guys who
weren’t afraid to play the victim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abYzI9ycjk">Everything She Wants</a> (by
Wham, 1984): George Michael is having a rough time with a no-good
money-grubbing girlfriend.  I smile every time he finds out
she’s pregnant and says “If my best isn’t good enough, how can it be
good enough for two?  I can’t work any harder than I do!” Maybe this was
the incident that turned him off women forever?  Not that there’s
anything wrong with that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu788foYCa8">I’ve Done Everything For You</a>
(Rick Springfield, 1981): Based on my analysis of his catalog, this
guy seems like he was just a bad boyfriend.  He lusted after his friend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs">Jessie’s girl</a>.  He told his girl not to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp42V938eBA">talk to strangers</a>.  And here
he says “I’ve done everything for you; you’ve done nothing for me!”
At least he was <a href="http://ztams.com/index.php?action=display&amp;ref=26342">good looking</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0">Don’t You Want Me?</a>(by
The Human League, 1981) This is another case of a guy who did
everything–“I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around”
and she’s got the nerve to dump him.  What’s unique in this song is that she
gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZW1C3neao">The Rain</a> (by Oran Juice
Jones, 1986): Here’s where we see that eighties male victimhood
crossed race lines.  The best part of the song is when we listen in on Mr. Jones
confronting his cheating girlfriend and telling her “You gotta get on
outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, punch-bucket-shoe-wearing
crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/06/03/unoriginal-ideas/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/06/03/unoriginal-ideas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of myself as a reasonably creative guy.  I’m not always coming
up with particularly useful or imporant ideas, but I like to think
they’re fairly unique.  Unique in a small town or among your friends is
one thing, but unique on the Internet is quite another.  I thought it
would be fun to share some ideas I had for posts that turned out be less
original than I first thought.</p>

<h2 id="is-height-normal">Is height normal?</h2>

<p>Adult height is one of the prototypical examples of a naturally
occurring normal distribution, but if you look at real data, it’s not
perfectly normal.  First off, it’s a mixture of men and women who
individually have pretty normal heights but quite different means (by
about 5”).  Second, the tails of the distribution are fatter than
normal.  That is, extremely short and tall people are far more common
than predicted by a pure normal distribution.  All this is explained
very nicely explained in two 2008 posts (<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-normally-distributed/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/11/25/distribution-of-adult-heights/">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-not-normally-distributed/">here</a>) by John D. Cook at <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">The Endeavor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nietzsche-and-pop-music">Nietzsche and pop music</h2>

<p>There aren’t very many 19th or 20th Century philosophers that inspire
pop songs. The Cure turned Albert Camus’ The Stranger into “Staring at
the Sea”, but up until a few weeks ago I thought that was it.  How wrong I
was!  Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I">What Doesn’t Kill You</a>” has been getting
tremendous airplay on pop stations and it’s not much different from
Christina Aguilera’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOJpIwF47Y">Fighter</a>” which also talks about how being
beaten down just makes her “stronger”, “harder”, and “wiser”.  And it
turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujhZoAg2-I">tons and tons of songs</a> have been inspired by this
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn159167.html">Nietzsche quote</a>.  I thought it would be fun to see how many more of
Nietzsche’s ideas (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#.C3.9Cbermensch">Superman</a>)  have been translated into pop
music (maybe “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan#Sunshine_Superman">Sunshine Superman</a>”?).  Turns out Craig
Schuftan has written a <a href="http://startnarrativehere.com/2010/01/hey-nietzsche-leave-them-kids-alone-the-romantic-movement-rock-roll-and-the-end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-by-craig-schuftan-2009">whole book</a> about this called
<em>Hey! Nietzsche! Leave Them Kids Alone!: The Romantic Movement, Rock &amp;
Roll, and the End of Civilisation as We Know It</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-impact-of-cleaning-the-augean-stables">The environmental impact of cleaning the Augean stables</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">The Fifth Labor of Heracles</a> was to clean the Augean stables.
They were so dirty and filthy that he had to divert two rivers through
them to wash out the manure that 1000 cattle had produced over thirty
years.  This reminded me of what happened when hurricanes hit North
Carolina a few years ago and pushed massive amounts of pig waste into
the water supply.  Wouldn’t it be interesting to write a quick
environmental impact statement for Hercules’ act?  A few people have
noticed that the effects were probably pretty serious (<a href="http://thepunnery.wordpress.com/tag/augean-stables/">The Punnery</a>,
<a href="http://hazwastemanagement.info/HazWasteManagement_Solutions/Chapter_16_HWM_2nd_ed_Solutions.pdf">this homework assignment</a> for a class on Hazardous Waste Management)
but no one has actually done any calculations to show how serious.
Hmm….maybe I can contribute something here!</p>

<h2 id="a-sitcom-about-a-woman-with-cancer">A sitcom about a woman with cancer.</h2>

<p>Last month I had a strange dream about developing a sitcom that starred
a woman who is diagnosed with cancer and goes through the whole
treatment process.  The story would have a full three year arc with
cliff-hangers every year when she (or her new best friend who also has
cancer) goes in for testing.  The final episode would be her saying
goodbye.  The show would have lots of funny kids, hair loss jokes, and
nausea jokes.  She could also start a romantic relationship in the
middle of the run.  An awfully large number of people have either had
cancer by now or had someone very close go through it.  I really believe
that a show like this would have a big audience of people who want to
laugh about a serious thing.  Showtime also believed this and started
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_C_(TV_series)">The Big C</a>” in 2010 and it’s entering its third season now.
According to Wikipedia, it’s been very successful since the beginning!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Got My Country On]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/20/country/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/20/country</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There have been times in my life when I’ve listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I’m pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get—that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don’t feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I’ve started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I’m as surprised as you are as I’ve always been an “I don’t like
country” guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I’m not totally sure what’s changed, but over the last few weeks
I’ve Shazamed several songs that I’ve had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">“Country Must Be Country Wide”</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it’s so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80’s.  It’s got awesome guitar and great lines like
“In every state there’s a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon”.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">“Got My Country On”</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is “Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars”.  He
even says he’s “Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">“This”</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn’t be more earnest: “Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this.”  I’ve never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">“Drink On It”</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It’s about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this will country thing be a fad for me.  Or maybe I’ll be wearing Wranglers and
cowboy boots by this time next year.  I’ll definitely pass on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/smokeless">Skoal</a> though.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/05/the-beatles-strange-obsession/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/05/the-beatles-strange-obsession</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Beatles played mostly sugary upbeat pop songs.  They have <em>at least
three</em> songs about good mornings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They sang that “All You Need is
Love” and “Octopus’s Garden” and “Yellow Submarine”.  The whole band
spent time in India getting in tune with their spiritual sides.  John
went on to “imagine all the people living life in peace” while Paul sang
“Ebony and Ivory” with Stevie Wonder.</p>

<p>All that’s true.  And so is the fact that they had a creepy obsession
with violence against women and serial killers.  It all started in 1965
with <em>Rubber Soul</em>’s final track: “Run for Your Life”.  I’ll lyrics
speak for themselves:</p>

<pre>
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man 
That's the end'a little girl
</pre>

<p>They followed this in 1967 with Sgt. Pepper’s “Getting Better”.  I loved
this song when I was a kid and thought nothing of these lines:</p>

<pre>
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart 
  from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, things were not getting better.  In 1968 the Beatles
released the White Album which was full of songs that went on to inspire
renowned serial killer Charles Manson.  The lyrics to Manson’s favorite
song (“Helter Skelter”) are a little opaque (e.g., “When I get to the
bottom I go back to the top of the slide”) but Manson sure knew what
they meant.</p>

<p>And finally, on the last album they recorded together (<em>Abbey Road</em>),
the Beatles transparently glamourized a serial killer named Maxwell
Edison who by the end of the song bludgeons to death two women and a
male magistrate:</p>

<pre>
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
</pre>

<p>The Beatles were an incredibly talented and versatile band.  They’ve
inspired countless musicians over the years.  Perhaps it’s time to give
them credit for inspiring some 1990’s sicko metal (and nü-metal)
bands like Slayer and Korn too.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/02/home-music-streaming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I write because I’ve learned or created something interesting
that I want to share. Sometimes I write because I’m so appalled by
something I need to get it off my chest. But rarely is it both. About a
week ago I was ready to write a scathing post describing my really great
but really unstable home music system.  Things are a lot better now, but
I still wanted to share.</p>

<p>The hardware is a combination of old Apple parts and stereo equipment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An Airport Express that I bought on eBay for $55 connected to an old
Bose Acoustic Wave (also bought on eBay) in the kitchen </li>
  <li>An iMac in the office with my entire 76 GB music collection stored in mp3’s
and de-drm’ed AAC files</li>
  <li>A 1.0 AppleTV connected to a traditional stereo system in the
living room </li>
</ul>

<p>With this set up, I run iTunes on the Mac and can have it play in any
or all of the three locations at any time.  With the Remote iPhone app,
I can control it from anywhere in the house.  Sounds nice, right?
Unfortunately, I would have to reboot my wireless router (a 2wire from
Uverse) a couple times a day because the Remote app would spontaneously
stop talking to the Mac. And then a few times a week I would have to
reboot the Mac because it would stop talking to the kitchen Airport
Express and the living room AppleTV.  Grr….</p>

<p>I had no idea what was going on until I stopped using the Parallels
virtual machine software on the Mac. I had been running MS Office in a
Windows 7 vm, but finally got sick of the quirks and just installed the Mac
native version of Office. It took me a couple weeks to notice that I
never had to reboot the router again. Damn you Parallels!  I don’t know
how you messed up the network, but you did!  Then I noticed that the
Mac only stopped talking to the other devices when I used the Yale
VPN. And when I got off and even quit out of the Cisco VPN app, it
<em>still</em> couldn’t connect until I rebooted.  Two applications messing up
the network?  Hmm….makes me wonder if maybe a bug in the OS is to
blame.</p>

<p>So as of today, I still don’t know why those two apps were causing
problems, but I don’t have any more surprises. I don’t use Parallels and
I always reboot after using the VPN.  This keeps the 80’s music
flowing. The system still isn’t perfect. I want to add another output
node in the basement. I want to install Airfoil and stream Spotify
throughout the house. And the Remote app takes way longer than it should
to connect when it starts. But for the most part, I can listen to
whatever I want wherever I want and that makes me happy.</p>
