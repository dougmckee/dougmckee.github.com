<p>I found out about Rafal’s blog when he commented on <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/27/gtd-with-rtm/">a post here</a>, but it’s quickly become my favorite source for thoughtful advice about improving personal productivity.  He reads widely and links to the best articles he finds on the topic. But the reason I keep coming back is his own writing.  For whatever reason, he and I run into very similar issues and he has practical ideas for making progress on those issues. Recently he’s written good stuff about <a href="http://www.thinkinprojects.com/productivity/celebrate-2/">the value in looking back at our accomplishments</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkinprojects.com/productivity/planning-2013/">long range planning</a>, and <a href="http://www.thinkinprojects.com/productivity/on-avoidance-of-stuff/">avoiding what’s important</a>.  He also happens to write extensively about <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> and <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>–two tools I respect but don’t currently use.</p>

<p>This site is written by a former student of mine from Spain who has spent big chunks of this life in Africa and is now living in Japan.  He has a unique perspective on the world and through words and photos he communicates a great sense for both the ordinary and extraordinary in Japan.  Reading his blog I often feel like I’m watching a Japanese version of the Office. Alf also partakes in a tremendous number of extracurricular activities so I get to learn all about soccer leagues, concerts, themed restaurants, and video game arcades too. And seriously, how many people do you know that have taken a <a href="http://sillynomad.tumblr.com/day/2012/12/20">field trip to Hiroshima to play Dungeons and Dragons</a>?</p>

<p>Shrutarshi Basu is a computer science grad student at Cornell, but I started reading his blog back when he was “just” a nerdy college kid. He writes about what he’s doing (hacking, figuring out life) and what he thinks is important (e.g., programming languages, reading, productivity). While it’s true that we do share some interests, my favorite quality of the site is Shrutarshi’s earnestness. He consciously tries to achieve excellence in whatever he does and he’s open about what’s working and what’s not.</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/01/08/an-homage-to-chris-welty</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the Internet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Welty">Chris Welty</a> is now a research scientist at IBM’s TJ Watson Research Center in upstate New York.  He works on knowledge representation and the semantic web and was one of the developers behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)">Watson</a>, the computer program that kicked ass on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a>  He also taught Intro to Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer</a> in the late 1980’s. As far as I know, he is alive and well. But life comes and goes and I really like the idea of writing this  while he is still around to read it. You don’t always get <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/01/05/dr-bob-cupper">that chance</a>. </p>

<p>I showed up at Rensselaer in 1986 extremely excited to learn how to turn computers into people.  I grew up on science fiction like Asimov’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot">I Robot</a> and was certain we were on the threshold of true software-based intelligent beings.  I knew the average person wasn’t that smart–how hard could it possibly be to write code that could simulate their basic skills?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>In the spring of my sophomore year I took Professor Welty’s Intro to AI class and it was everything I could have hoped for. Professor Welty was not quite as young as I was, but he was certainly as excited as any of us about the box full toys we got to play with.  Mini-max algorithms, backward-chaining, forward chaining, Lisp, semantic networks–I could go on and on. I put serious work into that class, but it was also a serious amount of fun.  This was the only class in college that actually inspired me to work all night on projects.</p>

<p>You might think that with subject matter this good, anyone could have taught a great class, but you’d be wrong.  Now that I spend big chunks of my own time standing in the front of the classroom, I realize all the work he put in and the skills he had.  The problem sets were engaging. The in-class explanations of concepts were clear and polished and yet the classes were very conversational.  In Professor Welty’s class everyone felt comfortable raising their hand.</p>

<p>I don’t do AI anymore, but I use what I learned in that class every day: Hold yourself to a high standard.  Be present. Share. Do what you love. Have fun.  Thanks Professor Welty!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/01/04/siracusa-2016/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/01/04/siracusa-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hv-siracusa-2016.jpg" alt="Siracusa 2016" /></p>

<p>Fellow Americans, our country has come a long way in the last 50 years. We have had our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">Catholic president</a>, our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">African-American president</a>, and almost our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Mormon president</a>. In a few generations we will almost certainly have our first gay president. I say the time has come for our first geek president and John Siracusa is the perfect<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> person for the job.</p>

<p>For those of you who have never heard of him, Mr. Siracusa is a software developer by day and an ace gamer, devoted father, loving husband, and nerd celebrity by night. He’s most known for his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/">tour-de-force</a> reviews of (Mac) OS X and more recently for his wide-ranging soapbox podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a>.  It is these venues where Mr. Siracusa has demonstrated he has the skills our country needs.</p>

<p>He is the ultimate natural analyst, able to glance at anything and quickly identify its strengths and (especially) weaknesses. While he typically applies his super-power to tech products<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, it will be amazing to see him use it to intelligently dissect and choose among potential public policies.  </p>

<p>Mr. Siracusa is also blessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_thing">big picture vision</a>, a critical requirement for a successful chief executive.  He can tell you about the future of <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/31">computing</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/63">software distribution</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/1">TV</a>, and even <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/18">toasters</a>. His ideas about using <a href="http://the-magazine.org/2/strange-game">artificial worlds as petri dishes for social policy</a> are exciting and promising (if not <a href="http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/articles/126.pdf">completely original</a>). Once he throws off the corporation-imposed shackles banning political discourse that bound him on Hypercritical, I am certain we will see a beautiful clear vision for the future of America and indeed the planet. </p>

<p>Mr. Siracusa has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">integrity</a>, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp">humility</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal">moral compass</a> that the American public wants in a president but is so often lacking. He has a warm heart and is unafraid to defend unpopular groups–nerds, cosplaying-wanna-be-nerds, homosexuals, and trans-sexuals are all welcome in <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/96">his big tent</a>.  He’s a humble every-man who is able to <a href="http://vimeo.com/46369728">make fun of himself</a> and his election season cameos on Saturaday Night Live will surely be hilarious. While a presidential campaign always brings out the muck rackers, I’d be shocked if they unearthed any Siracusa scandals.</p>

<p>December 28, 2012 was a sad day as the <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/100">final Hypercritical episode</a> was recorded, but think about it this way: John Siracusa now has a big hole in his schedule to fill.  America needs him!</p>

      <p>OK, he’s not <em>perfect</em>. I don’t know if he’s ever left the country so maybe he’d have to brush up on foreign policy.  And sure, he has no executive experience and eschews management jobs.  And he doesn’t like risk.  But <em>no one</em> is perfect.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>My favorite example is his obsession with video game controllers which he demonstrates convincingly in episodes <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/49">49</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/50">50</a>, and <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/99">99</a> of Hypercritical.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
