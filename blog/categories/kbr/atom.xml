    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it turns out there are <a href="http://www.teachmentortexts.com/2014/07/its-monday-what-are-you-reading-71414_13.html#axzz37V4D0PXw">people out on the Internet</a> out on the Internet besides me that read and review picture books! Not only that, a whole bunch of them gather on Mondays to share their latest favorites. I guess this has something to do with this “social media” thing that is so trendy these days. Sigh, I feel so old.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the three books in heavy rotation on right now with my three year-old that I love:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-alexander.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0590430122">Alexander and the Wind-up Mouse</a> (written and illustrated by Leo Lionni) I’ve written about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/">my love for Leo Lionni</a> before and this is my personal favorite. It’s got magic lizards, beautiful artwork, and the last page brings a tear to my eye every time I read it. The amazing thing is that my three year old seems to love it just as much as I do.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-norman.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norman-Doorman-Picture-Puffins-Freeman/dp/0140502882">Norman the Doorman</a> (written and illustrated by Don Freeman) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a> gets more attention, but Don Freeman was far from a one-trick pony. This book about a mouse that works at a museum by day and creates art at night is lovely story with a sweet message.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-zack.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zacks-Alligator-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064441865">Zack’s Alligator</a> (written by Shirley Mozelle and illustrated by James Watts) This story is pure fun and I’ve never met a kid who wouldn’t do anything to have Zack’s alligator keychain. It’s like reading a smarter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Danny-Dinosaur-Syd-Hoff/dp/0064440028">Danny and the Dinosaur</a> with a strong female lead character. </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/06/19/mister-men-and-little-misses/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/06/19/mister-men-and-little-misses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-mister-men-little-misses.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-little-miss-dotty.jpg"></p>

<p>For weeks now our house has been coated in a thin layer of Mister Men and Little Miss books. We have about 70 of these brilliant little square paperbacks, and both girls love them. My three year old carries bundles of them around the house in little bags. She pages through them looking at the pictures, trying to sound out the names, and laughing her head off. It takes her ten minutes to select just the right set to read at bedtime. My five year old will also grab a stack and try to wrap her brain around the stories and the British vocabulary.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that my wife and I amassed our collection before we had kids. <!--more-->My wife had fond memories of reading them while she babysat during high school and we figured our future kids would love them too. A <a href="http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/jere-behrman">good friend of ours</a> thought we were nuts. He said  you can only read a book so many times before it rots your brain. Kids often want their parents to read books twice that many times. His strategy was to shun all children’s books until he had to read them in hopes of not crossing the misery threshold with some of them. We ignored his advice and blissfully read on, and so far we’re still big fans of the Mister Men and Little Misses.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-mister-tickle.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hargreaves">Roger Hargreaves</a> started writing stories about the Mister Men in 1971. <em>Mr. Tickle</em>, his first, was 30 pages of bold colorful illustrations  accompanying a funny story of a little man with extraordinarily long arms and a love for tickling people. Roger went on to write 47 books about the Mister Men and another 34 about their female counterparts: the Little Misses. His son Adam has continued to write them since Roger passed away in 1988.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-little-miss-bossy.jpg"></p>

<p>In some ways, all these books are similar. The characters are fairly one dimensional.  Some are good (like Mr. Happy and Little Miss Fun), some are bad (like Little Miss Bossy and Mr. Mischief), and some just are what they are (like Mr. Tall and Little Miss Shy). The bad ones often (but not always) learn a lesson at the end. But the books are also quirky and unpolished–you never <em>really</em> know what’s going to happen. Some stories have odd twists (<em>Mr. Perfect</em>), others just peter out (like <em>Little Miss Curious</em>), and a few go right where you think they’re going (like <em>Mr. Daydream</em>). </p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-mister-men-back.jpg"></p>

<p>On the back of every book is a picture of every single Mister Man or Little Miss. Both girls love poring over these tiny portraits. The characters have distinctive colors, shapes, shoes, and hats and they often show up as secondary characters in other books. Recognizing them in the stories and finding them on the backs of the books is great fun. I have a feeling our whole family will be reading these stories for years to come.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/21/kbr-robots/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/21/kbr-robots</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>B is really into robots lately, and I thought it would be fun to share her favorite books that feature robots or have exciting robot-related scenes.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-robot-and-bluebird.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Robot-Bluebird-David-Lucas/dp/0374363307">The Robot and the Bluebird</a> (written and illustrated by David Lucas) This is a sweet story that takes on some heavy topics: love, sacrifice and even death. Spoiler alert: The bird comes out ok at the end, the robot not so much. The quirky drawings are wonderful, and honestly I think David Lucas is physically incapable of creating a book that’s not great.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-boy-+-bot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Bot-Ame-Dyckman/dp/0375867562">Boy + Bot</a> (written by Ame Dyckman, illustrated by Dan Yaccarino) We picked this up at the library a couple weeks ago and it’s still B’s dinner time favorite. The boy and the robot meet in the forest and start a friendship that’s briefly interrupted by a couple cute misunderstandings. Now whenever I ask B if she likes this book she smiles and says in a slow monotone: “Affirmative.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-lbg-mean-robot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladybug-Girl-Bumblebee-Jacky-Davis/dp/0803733399">Ladybug Girl and Bumblebee Boy</a> (written by Jacky Davis, illustrated by David Soman) This is our go-to bedtime book and it’s got Ladybug Girl playing Bug Squad at the playground with her new friend Sam. B loves when they pretend the tire swing is a mean robot and Lulu jumps on its head. And the other day at the playground we almost convinced a real boy to play Ladybug Bug girl with us! He wanted to be Mosquito Boy until his friend pulled him back to playing Ninjas.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-critter-giant-robot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Just Go to Bed</a> (written and illustrated by Mercer Mayer) The Critter books are like cheese sandwiches–they aren’t the most creative stories, but they are consistently good. I might appreciate this one more than the girls because we live it almost every night. Critter keeps coming up with excuses for not going to bed while his parents play along but get more and more exasperated. At  one point Critter is a space cadet and Dad (the giant robot) captures him. If only that were the end of the story.</li>

    <updated>2013-12-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/16/kid-book-review-second-time-around</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things about having a second child is getting to do all your favorite little kid things again.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Near the top of that list for me is re-reading our best picture books, and L, at 2.5 years old is just now appreciating the stories as well as the pictures. These five books have been particularly popular over the last few weeks:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-uncle-elephant.jpg" title="[title “Uncle Elephant”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Elephant-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064441040">Uncle Elephant</a> (written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel) Like all of Arnold Lobel’s books, the illustrations are classic, the stories are clever, and the messages are deep. A boy loses his parents at the beginning and he bonds with his Uncle who takes care of him until his parents come back. Among other things, they walk in the garden, sing songs, and grant wishes to spiders. Uncle Elephant is the grandfather everyone wanted when they were growing up. We’ve also been enjoying Lobel’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=lobel%20frog%20and%20toad">Frog and Toad stories</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">Pup and Hound Catch a Thief</a> (written by Susan Hood, illustrated by Linda Hendry) This criminally under-rated series of books is published by Kids Can Press where it gets lost in a slew of mediocre tales of poorly behaved cats (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mittens-My-First-Can-Read-ebook/dp/B006JQTQNG">Mittens</a>) and dogs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pizza-Sam-Kids-Can-Read/dp/1553373316">Sam</a>). The rhymes and artwork are cute, and the stories have twists at the end that both L and I can appreciate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-lyle-walks-the-dogs.jpg" title="[title “Lyle Walks the Dogs”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lyle-Crocodile-Walks-Dogs/dp/B006Z31NI4">Lyle Walks the Dogs</a> (written by Bernard Waber, illustrated by Paulis Waber) Not to be confused with <a href="">Zack’s Alligator</a> Bridget, Lyle the Crocodile is as sweet as Bridget is sassy. In this counting book Lyle builds a business through competent hard work and positive word of mouth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curious-George-Rides-Bike-Rey/dp/B0099R035M">Curious George Rides a Bike</a> (written and illustrated by H.A. Rey) My personal favorite George book when I was a kid, I’m happy to report that L loves it too, even if she does admonish George for not wearing a helmet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-there-are-cats-in-this-book.jpg" title="[title “There are cats in this book”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/There-Are-Cats-This-Book/dp/0763639230">There Are Cats in This Book</a> (written and illustrated by Viviane Schwarz) I’m cheating here since we just discovered this book a month ago at the library, but it’s just so good and so perfect for the two year old age group that I had to include it. It follows in the interactive mode of Herve Tullet’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Press-Here-Herve-Tullet/dp/0811879542">Press Here</a> asking the reader to do things (like toss a ball of yarn or look inside a box) and reacting to them. The only potential downside is that the pop-up features are not totally robust, but isn’t that what Scotch tape is for? I just realized there’s a well-reviewed sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/There-Are-Cats-this-Book/dp/0763649546">There are no cats in this book</a>) and can’t wait to check that out too!</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/04/11/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-3/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/04/11/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We haven’t read much new in the last six months, and while I’d like to take the blame and say it’s because we’ve been busy with work and other commitments, I’m instead going to throw my almost two year old daughter under the bus. While R (who is 4.5 now) is an extreme reader, L has not been very excited about reading. Or about anyone else reading. So instead of all of us enjoying a long cuddle on the couch working through a stack of books, this would quickly devolve into yelling and then R going off to read on her own, L going off to cook in her kitchen, and just me and Curious George sitting there wondering what to do next.  I’m happy to say we have recently turned a corner and L now actually seeks out the social reading experience and we’re back to moving big stacks of books back and forth from the library.</p>

<p>Our last two trips have yielded some keepers, some honorable mentions, and even a couple dishonorable mentions.</p>

<h2 id="keepers">Keepers:</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-cowboy-and-octopus.jpg" title="[title “Cowboy and Octopus”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cowboy-Octopus-Jon-Scieszka/dp/0670910589">Cowboy and Octopus</a> (by Jon Scieszka, illustrated by Lane Smith) This collection of 7 very short stories about two good friends has something for everyone. L loves the characters and how the cowboy says “Yee Haw!”. Roxana loves the knock-knock joke and when Octopus gets hammered by Cowboy. I love the adult layer of humor and the style that is a combination of collage and old-school comic book illustration. Win win win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Crumps-Cat-Linda-Smith/dp/0060283025">Mrs. Crump’s Cat</a> (by Linda Smith, illustrated by David Roberts) A hungry stray cat shows up at an annoyed Mrs. Crump’s door. But as soon as she describes him as “exquisite” and “golden” you know how the story is going to end. So cute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cook---Doodle-Doo-Janet-Stevens/dp/0152056580">Cook-a-Doodle-Doo!</a> (by Janet Stevens and Susan Stevens Crummel, illustrated by Janet Stevens) Rooster is tired of the same old food and decides to bake a cake. Turtle, Iguana, and Pot-bellied Pig “help” and along the way we learn a whole bunch about baking. It’s a great combination of funny, sweet, and truly educational.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frog-Inside-My-Hat-First/dp/0816731306">A Frog Inside My Hat: A First Book of Poems</a> (compiled by Fay Robinson, illustrated by Cyd Moore) Both girls love the simple fun poems collected in this book and L especially loves flipping through it on her own and looking at the pictures–she calls it “the froggie book”. At these ages reading poetry is completely normal and I hope we can keep it that way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/At-Supermarket-Anne-Rockwell/dp/080507662X">At the Supermarket</a> (by Anne Rockwell) L’s favorite of the bunch is about a boy who goes to the supermarket with his mom. The big twist is that they buy the ingredients for his birthday cake and make it the next day for the party. The author wrote and illustrated a similar book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-SUPERMARKET-Anne-Rockwell/dp/0027775801">Supermarket</a> in 1979 and this “updated” version was published in 2010. My favorite part is that it still seems like a 1980’s period piece: There are no laser scanners. No one uses reusable shopping bags. Everyone’s driving station wagons. I can’t wait until Amazon sends me a copy of the original so I can see what actually got updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yard-Full-Birds-Anne-Rockwell/dp/002777273X">Our Yard is Full of Birds</a> (by Anne Rockwell, illustrated by Lizzy Rockwell) Both girls love looking at birds in our yard and this helps them identify who is who.  Only downside is it makes them want a bird bath even more than they already did. And when your kids are little, bird bath = extra dirty outdoor kid bath.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions:</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-jims-lion.jpg" title="[title “Jim’s Lion”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jims-Lion-Russell-Hoban/dp/0763611751">Jim’s Lion</a> (by Russell Hoban, illustrated by Ian Andrew) On the first page, Jim says from his hospital bed that “People who have what I have, mostly they die, don’t they?” It gave me the chills and I immediately realized that neither of my girls are old enough for this story. But what a vivid and hopeful story it is. Wow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Uri-Shulevitz/dp/0374416893">Dawn</a> (by Uri Shulevitz) The art is beautiful and the story is subtle–The sky and the silence are the stars and the grandfather and his son are just supporting characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hero-Cat-Eileen-Spinelli/dp/0761458379">Hero Cat</a> (by Eileen Spinelli, illustrated by Jo Ellen McAllister Stammen) I am a sucker for true stories about animals helping other animals. This one has a mom cat rescuing her babies from a burning building. If you read it with feeling, it’s pretty dramatic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sarahs-Little-Ghosts-Thierry-Robberecht/dp/B003NHR7D0">Sarah’s Little Ghosts</a> (by Thierry Robberecht, illustrated by Philippe Goossens) This story is very creative and has a great message. Sarah sneaks into her mom’s jewelry box, breaks her favorite necklace, and then hides the evidence. She feels terribly guilty and everytime she lies about it, another ghost flies out of her mouth. Finally, she can’t take it anymore, comes clean, and feels a lot better. R and I read this one very carefully, and I think she even understood what was going on.  Score one for the good guys!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dishonorable-mentions">Dishonorable mentions:</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-big-elephant.jpg" title="[title “The Big Elephant in the Room”]" ></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Elephant-Room-Lane-Smith/dp/1423116674">The Big Elephant in the Room</a> (by Lane Smith) This story revolves around two donkeys.  One says they need to talk about the “big elephant in the room” and the other is sure he is asking about the myriad of terrible things he’s been doing and confesses to all of them. These include eating all the ice cream, breaking the computer, stealing a video game, and even telling a mutual friend about a pee accident. My girls do not need <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2011/12/30/bad-behavior/">books giving them more ideas for bad behavior</a>–they’ve got that covered already.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladybug-Girl-Beach-Jacky-Davis/dp/0803734166">Ladybug Girl at the Beach</a> (by David Soman and Jacky Davis) I like Ladybug Girl, R loves Ladybug Girl, and we own several Ladybug Girl books. She’s curious, creative, and adventurous. Our best guess is that she and R are both about the same age (between 4 and 5) Her parents are mostly absent, and that’s OK when the story takes place in the backyard or at the playground. At the beach, however, very bad things can happen when parents aren’t around. Like kids drowning bad. In this book Lulu wanders all around the beach by herself and almost gets pulled out to sea without anyone even noticing. As far as I can tell, the message is that you shouldn’t be afraid of sneaking off by yourself to play in the waves when you’re four years old. My four year old already thinks she can swim–I’d rather not encourage that delusion.</p>
