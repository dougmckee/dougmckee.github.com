    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of myself as a reasonably creative guy.  I’m not always coming
up with particularly useful or imporant ideas, but I like to think
they’re fairly unique.  Unique in a small town or among your friends is
one thing, but unique on the Internet is quite another.  I thought it
would be fun to share some ideas I had for posts that turned out be less
original than I first thought.</p>

<h2 id="is-height-normal">Is height normal?</h2>

<p>Adult height is one of the prototypical examples of a naturally
occurring normal distribution, but if you look at real data, it’s not
perfectly normal.  First off, it’s a mixture of men and women who
individually have pretty normal heights but quite different means (by
about 5”).  Second, the tails of the distribution are fatter than
normal.  That is, extremely short and tall people are far more common
than predicted by a pure normal distribution.  All this is explained
very nicely explained in two 2008 posts (<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-normally-distributed/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/11/25/distribution-of-adult-heights/">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-not-normally-distributed/">here</a>) by John D. Cook at <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">The Endeavor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nietzsche-and-pop-music">Nietzsche and pop music</h2>

<p>There aren’t very many 19th or 20th Century philosophers that inspire
pop songs. The Cure turned Albert Camus’ The Stranger into “Staring at
the Sea”, but up until a few weeks ago I thought that was it.  How wrong I
was!  Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I">What Doesn’t Kill You</a>” has been getting
tremendous airplay on pop stations and it’s not much different from
Christina Aguilera’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOJpIwF47Y">Fighter</a>” which also talks about how being
beaten down just makes her “stronger”, “harder”, and “wiser”.  And it
turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujhZoAg2-I">tons and tons of songs</a> have been inspired by this
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn159167.html">Nietzsche quote</a>.  I thought it would be fun to see how many more of
Nietzsche’s ideas (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#.C3.9Cbermensch">Superman</a>)  have been translated into pop
music (maybe “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan#Sunshine_Superman">Sunshine Superman</a>”?).  Turns out Craig
Schuftan has written a <a href="http://startnarrativehere.com/2010/01/hey-nietzsche-leave-them-kids-alone-the-romantic-movement-rock-roll-and-the-end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-by-craig-schuftan-2009">whole book</a> about this called
<em>Hey! Nietzsche! Leave Them Kids Alone!: The Romantic Movement, Rock &amp;
Roll, and the End of Civilisation as We Know It</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-impact-of-cleaning-the-augean-stables">The environmental impact of cleaning the Augean stables</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">The Fifth Labor of Heracles</a> was to clean the Augean stables.
They were so dirty and filthy that he had to divert two rivers through
them to wash out the manure that 1000 cattle had produced over thirty
years.  This reminded me of what happened when hurricanes hit North
Carolina a few years ago and pushed massive amounts of pig waste into
the water supply.  Wouldn’t it be interesting to write a quick
environmental impact statement for Hercules’ act?  A few people have
noticed that the effects were probably pretty serious (<a href="http://thepunnery.wordpress.com/tag/augean-stables/">The Punnery</a>,
<a href="http://hazwastemanagement.info/HazWasteManagement_Solutions/Chapter_16_HWM_2nd_ed_Solutions.pdf">this homework assignment</a> for a class on Hazardous Waste Management)
but no one has actually done any calculations to show how serious.
Hmm….maybe I can contribute something here!</p>

<h2 id="a-sitcom-about-a-woman-with-cancer">A sitcom about a woman with cancer.</h2>

<p>Last month I had a strange dream about developing a sitcom that starred
a woman who is diagnosed with cancer and goes through the whole
treatment process.  The story would have a full three year arc with
cliff-hangers every year when she (or her new best friend who also has
cancer) goes in for testing.  The final episode would be her saying
goodbye.  The show would have lots of funny kids, hair loss jokes, and
nausea jokes.  She could also start a romantic relationship in the
middle of the run.  An awfully large number of people have either had
cancer by now or had someone very close go through it.  I really believe
that a show like this would have a big audience of people who want to
laugh about a serious thing.  Showtime also believed this and started
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_C_(TV_series)">The Big C</a>” in 2010 and it’s entering its third season now.
According to Wikipedia, it’s been very successful since the beginning!</p>
