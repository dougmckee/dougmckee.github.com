    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Jared Diamond’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552">Guns Germs and Steel</a>,
he asserts that zebras cause more injuries to zoo keepers than any other
animal. At least that’s how I remember it–I gave my copy away years ago
and never replaced it. In any event, it’s common knowledge that <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Woman-bitten-by-Zebra.jpg">zebras are mean</a> and you can’t really tame them. Horses on the other hand are
every little girl’s best friend and they are happy to wear <a href="http://michellewrighton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dsc_4039.jpg">garlands of flowers</a> and <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2659658105_d8bccd69f1.jpg">nibble apples out of your hand</a>.  Why such a difference when
on the surface zebras just seem like striped horses?</p>

<p>Before I go any further I should say that the rest of this post is a
pure mixture of Wikipedia and armchair theorizing. You have been warned.</p>

<p>The answer has to be geography. The savanna is a
<a href="http://babeinthebush.blogspot.com/2009/08/luangwa-battlefield-of-hippo-part-5.html">tough place</a>. It’s
got cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs (that also make <a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/animalsnature/african-wild-dogs/">terrible pets</a>),
crocodiles (near the water anyway) and of course lions. Friendly and
laid back on the savanna equals dead. You have to be fierce
(zebras/meerkats), big (elephants/hippos/rhinos/giraffes) or fast and
high strung (impalas and ostriches) to survive.  But what about those friendly
monkeys that like to sit on shoulders in the bazaar?  Don’t they live on
the savanna? Well they can watch the action from the tops of trees and
eat their bananas in peace.  Zebras don’t have that option.</p>

<p>The temperate grasslands where horses evolved are a whole different
story. A lot more empty space and a lot fewer predators mean horses
could afford to just horse around all day before humans came along and
domesticated them.  Even the
<a href="http://www.fws.gov/rockymountainarsenal/kids/puzzles/PredatorsofthePrairie.pdf">temperate grassland predators</a>
are basically wild house pets. Wolves are genetically identical to dogs
and nothing else is big enough to give a horse more than a kick in the
shin.</p>

<p>Of course this very reasonable explanation doesn’t change the fact that
it’s grossly unfair that we can’t ride zebras around for fun–I mean
that would be so cool!  Maybe someday someone will splice nice genes
into the zebra (or striped genes into the horse) and I’ll get to live
the dream. Until then I’ll stick to the mountain bike for my riding
adventures. Oh well.</p>
