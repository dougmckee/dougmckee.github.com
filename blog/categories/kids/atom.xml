    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it turns out there are <a href="http://www.teachmentortexts.com/2014/07/its-monday-what-are-you-reading-71414_13.html#axzz37V4D0PXw">people out on the Internet</a> out on the Internet besides me that read and review picture books! Not only that, a whole bunch of them gather on Mondays to share their latest favorites. I guess this has something to do with this “social media” thing that is so trendy these days. Sigh, I feel so old.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the three books in heavy rotation on right now with my three year-old that I love:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-alexander.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0590430122">Alexander and the Wind-up Mouse</a> (written and illustrated by Leo Lionni) I’ve written about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/">my love for Leo Lionni</a> before and this is my personal favorite. It’s got magic lizards, beautiful artwork, and the last page brings a tear to my eye every time I read it. The amazing thing is that my three year old seems to love it just as much as I do.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-norman.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norman-Doorman-Picture-Puffins-Freeman/dp/0140502882">Norman the Doorman</a> (written and illustrated by Don Freeman) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a> gets more attention, but Don Freeman was far from a one-trick pony. This book about a mouse that works at a museum by day and creates art at night is lovely story with a sweet message.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-zack.jpeg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zacks-Alligator-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064441865">Zack’s Alligator</a> (written by Shirley Mozelle and illustrated by James Watts) This story is pure fun and I’ve never met a kid who wouldn’t do anything to have Zack’s alligator keychain. It’s like reading a smarter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Danny-Dinosaur-Syd-Hoff/dp/0064440028">Danny and the Dinosaur</a> with a strong female lead character. </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/06/19/mister-men-and-little-misses/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/06/19/mister-men-and-little-misses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-mister-men-little-misses.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-little-miss-dotty.jpg"></p>

<p>For weeks now our house has been coated in a thin layer of Mister Men and Little Miss books. We have about 70 of these brilliant little square paperbacks, and both girls love them. My three year old carries bundles of them around the house in little bags. She pages through them looking at the pictures, trying to sound out the names, and laughing her head off. It takes her ten minutes to select just the right set to read at bedtime. My five year old will also grab a stack and try to wrap her brain around the stories and the British vocabulary.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that my wife and I amassed our collection before we had kids. <!--more-->My wife had fond memories of reading them while she babysat during high school and we figured our future kids would love them too. A <a href="http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/jere-behrman">good friend of ours</a> thought we were nuts. He said  you can only read a book so many times before it rots your brain. Kids often want their parents to read books twice that many times. His strategy was to shun all children’s books until he had to read them in hopes of not crossing the misery threshold with some of them. We ignored his advice and blissfully read on, and so far we’re still big fans of the Mister Men and Little Misses.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-mister-tickle.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hargreaves">Roger Hargreaves</a> started writing stories about the Mister Men in 1971. <em>Mr. Tickle</em>, his first, was 30 pages of bold colorful illustrations  accompanying a funny story of a little man with extraordinarily long arms and a love for tickling people. Roger went on to write 47 books about the Mister Men and another 34 about their female counterparts: the Little Misses. His son Adam has continued to write them since Roger passed away in 1988.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-little-miss-bossy.jpg"></p>

<p>In some ways, all these books are similar. The characters are fairly one dimensional.  Some are good (like Mr. Happy and Little Miss Fun), some are bad (like Little Miss Bossy and Mr. Mischief), and some just are what they are (like Mr. Tall and Little Miss Shy). The bad ones often (but not always) learn a lesson at the end. But the books are also quirky and unpolished–you never <em>really</em> know what’s going to happen. Some stories have odd twists (<em>Mr. Perfect</em>), others just peter out (like <em>Little Miss Curious</em>), and a few go right where you think they’re going (like <em>Mr. Daydream</em>). </p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-mister-men-back.jpg"></p>

<p>On the back of every book is a picture of every single Mister Man or Little Miss. Both girls love poring over these tiny portraits. The characters have distinctive colors, shapes, shoes, and hats and they often show up as secondary characters in other books. Recognizing them in the stories and finding them on the backs of the books is great fun. I have a feeling our whole family will be reading these stories for years to come.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/21/kbr-robots/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/21/kbr-robots</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>B is really into robots lately, and I thought it would be fun to share her favorite books that feature robots or have exciting robot-related scenes.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-robot-and-bluebird.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Robot-Bluebird-David-Lucas/dp/0374363307">The Robot and the Bluebird</a> (written and illustrated by David Lucas) This is a sweet story that takes on some heavy topics: love, sacrifice and even death. Spoiler alert: The bird comes out ok at the end, the robot not so much. The quirky drawings are wonderful, and honestly I think David Lucas is physically incapable of creating a book that’s not great.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-boy-+-bot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Bot-Ame-Dyckman/dp/0375867562">Boy + Bot</a> (written by Ame Dyckman, illustrated by Dan Yaccarino) We picked this up at the library a couple weeks ago and it’s still B’s dinner time favorite. The boy and the robot meet in the forest and start a friendship that’s briefly interrupted by a couple cute misunderstandings. Now whenever I ask B if she likes this book she smiles and says in a slow monotone: “Affirmative.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-lbg-mean-robot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladybug-Girl-Bumblebee-Jacky-Davis/dp/0803733399">Ladybug Girl and Bumblebee Boy</a> (written by Jacky Davis, illustrated by David Soman) This is our go-to bedtime book and it’s got Ladybug Girl playing Bug Squad at the playground with her new friend Sam. B loves when they pretend the tire swing is a mean robot and Lulu jumps on its head. And the other day at the playground we almost convinced a real boy to play Ladybug Bug girl with us! He wanted to be Mosquito Boy until his friend pulled him back to playing Ninjas.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-critter-giant-robot.jpg"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Just Go to Bed</a> (written and illustrated by Mercer Mayer) The Critter books are like cheese sandwiches–they aren’t the most creative stories, but they are consistently good. I might appreciate this one more than the girls because we live it almost every night. Critter keeps coming up with excuses for not going to bed while his parents play along but get more and more exasperated. At  one point Critter is a space cadet and Dad (the giant robot) captures him. If only that were the end of the story.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Black metal for kids]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/04/black-metal-for-kids/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/04/black-metal-for-kids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Black metal is nasty stuff. Most of it revolves around Satanic imagery, shreiking vocals and guitars, incredibly fast “blast beat” drums, and spooky low fi production. Most bands hail from Scandinavia, and in the mid 90’s the nastiness reached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Satanic-Underground-Edition/dp/0922915946">particularly nasty level</a> as bands competed with each other to see who was the most evil by burning churches and murdering each other. And yet, I really appreciate the dark moodiness and musicality.</p>

<p>You can imagine my surprise when I found an honest-to-goodness Norwegian black metal band that is perfect for kids and adults. Now, whenever we get in the car, my two year old requests their music and proceeds to laugh and sing along! How did this happen? A confluence of two amazing things.</p>

<p>As I’ve already reported, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library/">my girls love the Rainbow Magic books</a>. While the heros are Kirsty, Rachel, and the fairies, the villains are Jack Frost and the goblins. Their home is an icy castle north of Fairy Land and they are frankly hilarious. The goblins call each other names, trip over each other, and are some of the least scary “monsters” you’ll ever meet. I remember in one book Rachel and Kirsty got their way by tickling the goblins.</p>

<p>The band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a> has been recording black metal since before their first full-length release: <em>Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism</em> in 1992. Their music is classic black metal, but many of their songs simply describe frigid mountains and the grumpy king who reigns over them. B’s favorite song is “Mountains of Might.” It starts with organ which B says is “carousel music” and contains vocals which she calls “a goblin talking:”</p>

<pre><code>The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
The winds are everblowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descend of the valley
Into the high impassable drifts
So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Forever standing here
These mountains northern face
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Icicled peeks as far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
</code></pre>

<p>The acoustic break in the middle is when “the goblins are dancing.” The whole album (<em>Blizzard Beasts</em>) is recorded with the vocals mixed extra loud so they don’t get lost. My favorite part is how Abbath (the lead singer) pronounces glaciers as “glaysseers”. The <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/antarctica-lyrics-immortal.html">lyrics of “Antarctica”</a> (from <em>Sons of Northern Darkness</em>) are similarly child-friendly and the music is similarly goblin-friendly.</p>

<p>The only downside to Immortal for kids is common to all heavy metal: the terribly inappropriate music videos. Immortal follows black metal tradition and performs in corpse paint while making lots of scary faces. They also seem to love weird spiked bondage gear. They look ridiculous and I try to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VBdAY8eA9w">their videos</a> too. It doesn’t have to be this way. Consider the video below to be my small contribution to making the world a better place:</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hv-alphabet-rug.jpg"></p>

<p>Consumption, analysis, and <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/">creation</a>. A lot of my time can be assigned to one of these three categories, and while all three have their place, I find it very easy to slouch into consumption and shirk creation. I feel better about myself when I’m in balance, so I’m always looking for opportunities to make things. That’s one reason the girls and I have been making up so <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/12/pretty-pretty-princess/">many</a> <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/21/non-violent-dungeons-and-dragons-for-kids/">new</a> <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/17/sequence-for-kids/">games</a> lately. </p>

<p>Our trips to the library have always been more than simply dropping off and picking up bags of books. We like to take our time and hang out too. These are our three favorite games to play while we’re there:</p>

<p><strong>1. The Rug Game:</strong> The main branch of the New Haven Free Public Library has a huge children’s room and in the middle is a big circular rug with the alphabet and associated pictures printed around the edge. Since R was little we’ve played a game where I tell her to find something and she has to run to an appropriate letter. We started with the basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run to the octopus!</li>
  <li>Where is the dog?</li>
  <li>Find the birthday cake!</li>
</ul>

<p>We moved on to more tricky questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What keeps you dry in the rain? (Umbrella)</li>
  <li>Who has 8 arms? (Octopus)</li>
  <li>Find a red fruit! (Apple)</li>
</ul>

<p>When other kids join in, the questions have to have at least two correct answers so everyone can find their own letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who swims in the water? (Fish, octopus, turtle)</li>
  <li>Find a fun toy! (yoyo, kite)</li>
  <li>What has a shell? (Turtle, egg)</li>
</ul>

<p>As the kids get older, the questions get downright tricky:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What rhymes with cry? (Pie)</li>
  <li>Who has a princess for a daughter? (Queen)</li>
  <li>Who is black and white? (Zebra)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Rainbow Magic:</strong> R is currently obsessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Magic">this series</a> of beginning chapter books. They are formulaic in the same way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_the_Explorer">Dora and Boots</a> are formulaic beginning readers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boys">The Hardy Boys</a> are formulaic tween boy schlock. The books come in sets of seven (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545175178/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0545175178&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=highvari-20">The Pet Fairies</a>) and each book involves two girls (Rachel and Kirsty) helping a particular fairy retrieve some magic item before Jack Frost and/or his goblins can get it. The books are quite harmless, and the thing is kids <em>like</em> formula–figuring it out is like solving a puzzle. B is not so into the stories yet, but she’s been swept up in R’s enthusiasm, and at the library she loves to gather up a big pile of the books, pore over the covers, and flip for pictures of goblins. We recently made up a game where she files her books by the first letter of the fairy’s name on the alphabet rug. Fun and even a little educational!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-picture-book-scavenger-hunt.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>3. Picture Book Scavenger Hunt:</strong> This is a game I’ve been trying to get the girls excited about for years, and during our last library outing it finally took hold. I made a list of animals, characters and objects, and the girls had to find a picture of each in a book. We settled in between two big shelves and started digging. It was surprisingly difficult–I would have told you that a third of all picture books contain princesses, fairies, pirates, and dogs. It turns out dogs are easy to find, but everything else took a little hunting. </p>

<p>I’ve written a lot recently about games we’ve made up and had a good time playing. I hope some of you are inspired to try a few out. I hope even more that you are inspired to create your own games. That’s the most fun of all.</p>
