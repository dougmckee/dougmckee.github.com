  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most grown-ups, even those without kids, have heard of Eric Carle—He is
an extremely popular children’s book author who illustrates using
collage.  In fact, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Bear-What-You-See/dp/0805047905">Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do See</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Hungry-Caterpillar-Eric-Carle/dp/0399226907">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> have now supplanted Margaret Wise Brown’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0694003611">Goodnight Moon</a> as the standard gift for newborn kids.</p>

<p>Both my daughters celebrated Eric Carle week at school last month
and it got me thinking (again) just how over-rated he is.  He’s
either today’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> or the kids’ version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinkade">Thomas Kinkade</a>
(“Painter of Light”).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  With a few exceptions (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Birthday-Message-Board-Book/dp/0694011487">The Secret Birthday Message</a>), his books couldn’t be more repetitive and formulaic.</p>

<p>I’m not saying his books have no redeeming qualities—the pictures are
pretty and they do appeal to the 1-2 year old crowd. But thats not
exactly the most demanding audience and his collage style isn’t even
unique. Leo Lionni started publishing picture books with collage back in
1959 and Lois Ehlert won a Caldecott in 1989 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Board-Book-Lois-Ehlert/dp/0694010677">Color Zoo</a>.</p>

<p>Leo Lionni in particular deserves far more attention than he gets. The
only good thing about many of his books being out of print is that it
made it slightly easier to pick four Lionni books to send to my sister’s
family for Christmas.</p>

<p>Lionni was a late bloomer as a children’s book author as he had a full
career as a “real” artist before writing
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Blue-Yellow-Leo-Lionni/dp/0688132855">Little Blue and Little Yellow</a>. His stories are quirky and many push
the envelope on what’s possible in a kids’ book.  And every one has a
positive message.  For example in his first book, the characters are
splotches of color who get mixed up and turn green.  Their parents don’t
recognize them until they cry themselves apart, but then the parents recognize
their mistake and learn not to be so judgmental.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flea-Story-Leo-Lionni/dp/0905478266">A Flea Story</a>, you never even see the main characters. Instead you
only hear a dialog that’s reminiscent of Herman Hesse’s odd couple
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Narcissus-Goldmund-Hermann-Hesse/dp/B003NQOS4M">Narcissus and Goldmund</a>. One flea just wants to stay home on their
dog’s butt while the other longs for adventure. They travel together for
a while and then split to follow their own paths. Stories that appeal to
both adults and children are rare and those that do usually have two
sets of jokes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a> is the classic example). Lionni
manages to make the same things funny to all ages.</p>

<p>One of R’s favorite Lioni stories is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matthews-Dream-Leo-Lionni/dp/067987318X">Matthew’s Dream</a>. Matthew is a poor
mouse who visits a museum with his school and is inspired to be an
artist. He dreams fantastic versions of his mundane world and paints
them into reality.  Often when R paints her own pictures she says “I’m
Matthew!”</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0394829115">Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</a>, Alexander yearns to be a windup
mouse who is loved by the family instead of hated and chased with a
broom. He finds a magical lizard who will grant him his wish in exchange
for a purple pebble.  By the time he acquires one, the world has changed
and he learns to be careful what he wishes for.  R still looks for
purple pebbles to give to the lizard.</p>

<p>My one year old does like flipping through Eric Carle board books, but
as soon as she will sit still and let us read to her, she’s graduating to
Leo Lionni. The pictures are even more beautiful, the stories are
awesome, and the whole family can enjoy the ride.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>My wife thinks it’s a cheap shot comparing Carle to Kinkade, but I
never miss a chance to bring up my favorite abusive alcoholic
religious nut-job artist, even if he did pass away recently.  And the
truth is, I think his work is pretty.  Just like Eric Carle’s.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The main goal of our biweekly trip to the New Haven Free Public Library is to
pick 20 or so great picture books.  I’m looking for books with beautiful
art, lovable (or at least memorable) characters, an original story, and
a positive message.  These books are rare and they’re difficult to
identify by a book spine, a book cover, or even a quick perusal.  And I
don’t have time for much more than that.</p>

<p>So the failure rate is high, but in this case failing isn’t all that bad
an outcome.  In fact, most books that come home succeed on at least one
dimension.  Sometimes the books are so spectacularly awful or
inappropriate that they stretch your brain.  And often R’s favorite
books are not my favorites.  The bottom line is that we both get a fair
amount out of reading the mediocre bulk of our haul, even when most get
returned never to be read again.</p>

<p>Our latest keepers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Umbrella-Queen-Shirin-Bridges/dp/0060750405">The Umbrella Queen</a> (by Shirin Yim Bridges, illustrated by Taeeun
  Yoo) I have a special place in my heart for atypical stories
  that take place in other countries.  And even better, I
  like stories about kids who are true to themselves.  This book takes
  place in Thailand and follows a girl whose inner artist cannot
  be squashed.  It reminds me a lot of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Empty-Pot-Demi/dp/0805082271">The Empty Pot</a>(by
  Demi) and I Ioved
  that too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Library-Lion-Michelle-Knudsen/dp/076363784X">Library Lion</a> (by Michelle Knudsen, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes) The
  lesson here is fantastic: Rules are good, but there are always
  extenuating circumstances when they should be broken.  The premise is
  absurd (a friendly helpful lion hangs out at the library) but not
  totally drug-addled (see
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hogula-Dread-Night-Jean-Gralley/dp/0805071644/">Hogula: the Dread Pig of the Night</a> (by
  Jean Gralley) for an
  example of the latter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Worker-Kate-Banks/dp/0374400008">The Night Worker</a> (by Kate Banks, illustrated by Georg Hallensleben)
A respectful portrayal of a Latino engineer who takes a son to the job
site one night.  Lots of construction equipment and beautiful almost
Gauguin-style paintings.  What’s not to love?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Dragon-Kate-Banks/dp/B003IWYJIG">Max’s Dragon</a>by Kate Banks, illustrated by Boris Kulikov) This
story is about two (older?) brothers playing croquet and their quirky
(younger?) brother who has a big imagination and loves rhymes.
Super-cute and super-original and the art is good though not my
favorite style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polar-Bear-Easy---Read-Puffin/dp/0140386920">A Polar Bear Can Swim</a> (by Harriet Ziefert, illustrated by Emily
Bolam) This book is designed for kids who are learning to read on
their own and who are curious about animals and science.  That’s a
perfect match for R.  It’s filled with fun facts (“A cow can drink 75
gallons of water in a day!”) and simple artwork.  I’m excited to check out
other members of the Viking Science Easy-to-Read series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balloons-Dee-Lillegard/dp/0525459405">Balloons Balloons Balloons</a> (by Dee Lillegard, illustrated by
Bernadette Pons) I admit I find this book a little brain-numbing, but
R is going to love any book that has a rabbit in a hot air balloon
dumping huge numbers of multicolored balloons on a whole town.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-River-Marjorie-Kinnan-Rawlings/dp/1416911790">The Secret River</a> (by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, illustrated by Leo
and Diane Dillon) This book is special.  It was written in 1947 by the
author of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yearling-Aladdin-Classics-Marjorie-Rawlings/dp/0689846231">The Yearling</a>
and it follows a poor black girl who lives in the rural South in the
early part of the 20th century.  I don’t have a lot of experience with
this environment, but it sure seems real to me.  The art is great and
the story is magical in a way that works for adults and children.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Honorable mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ginger-Bear-Mini-Grey/dp/0375842535">Ginger Bear</a> (by Mini Grey) R and I both like the part where Horace
smears cookie dough all over the toilet seat, but it goes downhill
from there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Really-Rabbits-Virginia-L-Kroll/dp/157091897X">Really Rabbits</a> (by Virginia Kroll, illustrated by Philomena
O’Neill) Cute story about two pet rabbits who do household chores in
the middle of the night.  We could use these guys in our house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Classic-Read-Book/dp/0061885177">Wonder Woman: I am Wonder Woman</a> (by Eric K. Stein, illustrated by
Rick Farley) An adaptation of a comic book?  Really? Yes!  Wonder Woman is a
positive role model for girls and R loves her tiara and bracelets.
And it doesn’t hurt that Dad had a thing for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Carter#Wonder_Woman">Linda Carter</a>
when he was in high school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Tour-Jarrett-Krosoczka/dp/0375833439">Punk Farm On Tour</a> (by Jarrett J. Krosoczka) It’s really quite good,
but if you already have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Jarrett-J-Krosoczka/dp/0440417937">Punk Farm</a> you’re not getting a whole lot
more here.  If you don’t have <em>Punk Farm</em> yet, you need to run out and
get it right away!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tricycle-Elisa-Amado/dp/0888996144">Tricycle</a> (by Elisa Amado, illustrated by Alfonso Ruano) A girl from
a wealthy family in Guatemala is friends with three poor kids next
door.  She sees them steal her tricycle but doesn’t say anything to
her parents because she knows she shouldn’t have left it in the bushes
and she already has a lot more stuff than they have.  I love the complex
emotions and the interplay of personal relationships and the gulf
between rich and poor that exists pretty much everywhere but is
especially stark in Latin America.  All of this is lost on R, but
she’s 3.  I’m not so sure she’ll get it at 5 either, but I commend the
authors for trying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When most people think of labs, they imagine scientists in white coats
staring into microscopes, carrying around beakers of bubbling chemicals, 
and holding test tubes over Bunsen burners.  In social science, the
reality is much more mundane.  It’s usually just a room full of
computers with software that may or may not be useful and may or may not
be up to date.  Even less compelling are the labs associated with
statistical methods classes.  The last couple years my own classes have
been the worst case scenario–I just get up and lecture about how my
students should use some particular piece of software to apply the
methods we’ve been learning in the “lecture” part of the class.  It
doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I will have the opportunity to teach two new
methods classes and completely re-invent how I incorporate labs.  I had
lunch with <a href="http://publichealth.yale.edu/cde/people/mayur_desai.profile">Mayur Desai</a> the other day and I think he does a great job
with labs in his classes and he’s inspired most (but not all) of the
ideas here.  This is what I’m thinking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>No lectures.  None.  Students enter the lab and get their assignment
    and spend the rest of the class trying to complete it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each assignment starts with a data set (preferably real) and a
    blank screen–that is, I don’t give them any code.  Their job is to
    answer a substantive question by applying methods we’ve covered
    recently to the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students work in pairs and take turns driving.  I think this keeps
    students focused and they can teach each other.  It also means only
    half the class has to have laptops if I want to implement a lab in a
    regular classroom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m around to answer questions.  In this way, it’s very different
    from a problem set where getting stuck on something dumb for hours
    at a time is a common occurrence.  Struggling with problem is good
    for learning, but banging your head against a wall isn’t an
    efficient use of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end product should be similar to results they might find
  in a published paper.  Sometimes I’ll provide an empty table they must
  fill in and other times they will produce their own tables of results
  from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be opportunities for quicker/more advanced students to
  do more.  One size does not fit all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While it’s possible to use any statistical analysis tool in a lab
successfully, I do think some packages are better than others.  Most
students already know Microsoft Excel and doing basic analyses (even
regression) using it is easy, but you really hit a wall when you want to
do anything even a little sophisticated.  SAS is powerful, but there is
a steep learning curve.  My plan is to use Stata.  You can browse your
data in a spreadsheet style interface.  You can play with commands
through the menus and when you choose one, it shows you the command-line
equivalent.  You can work interactively at the command-line or build
programs (using those same commands) in an editor.  And the
documentation is excellent and available online.</p>

<p>I’ll let you know how it goes!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago the girls and I went to the
<a href="http://peabody.yale.edu/">Peabody Natural History Musem</a> and learned that salamanders
and newts are very common animals in Connecticut.  The reason you never
see them is that they mostly hang out in places we don’t go.  Reading a
little further, I learned that the best chance for an encounter is near
water on a rainy early spring night.  </p>

<p>Last week R and I were reading one of our favorite poetry books
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Boatman-Caldecott-Ribbon-Nonfiction/dp/0618135472">Song of the Water Boatman and Other Pond Poems</a>) and I noticed that
it said early spring nights were a great time to hear peepers—these
tiny tree frogs congregate around ponds and to attract mates with their
calls.  I’d never heard peepers, but it sounded pretty cool.</p>

<p>Then yesterday evening, when the weather forecast told me it was going to be
our last rainy night for at least a week, I decided R and I needed to take a
quick trip to the neighborhood pond.  We got our rain boots,
rain coats, umbrellas, and flash lights and hopped into the car.  “Are
you excited?” I asked?  “Oh yes, very excited!” R replied.</p>

<p>We arrived at the trail head and while the batteries in my big maglight
were almost dead, R’s flashlight saved the day.  We tromped along and
quickly heard our first peepers!  They got quieter as we approached the
pond, so we turned off our lights and only talked in whispers.  Within a
minute, a peeper on the other side resumed calling.  We both thought it
was fantastic.</p>

<p>On the way back to the car we looked for salamanders and newts but came
up empty.  We also learned that balancing on wet logs in the rain
wearing rubber boots is harder than it looks.  At home we did some quick
Easter egg coloring and got ready for bed.  R was super excited to when
Mom suggested she wear her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carters-Hearts-Fleece-Sleeper-Pajamas/dp/B00719YPJA">Peeper jammies</a>.  </p>

<p>The whole trip lasted 30 minutes, but our memories will last a lifetime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love paper—wrapping paper, home made greeting cards, paper mâché
piñatas, a good coffee table book, any <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Wonderful-Wizard-Oz-Commemorative/dp/0689817517">Sabuda pop up book</a>, origami,
even (especially?) paper airplanes—it all makes me happy.  And up until
recently, paper played a big role in my workflow.  I read a lot of
research articles and generally, I would print them and write all over
them.  The act of taking notes forces me to engage and extract much more
than I would if I were passively reading.  These hand-annotated articles
would go into my file cabinet so I could refer to my notes next time I
read the article.  I also grade about 100 student papers per semester
and like to provide copious feedback.  Since my work days are spread
between two or three campus offices and a home office, my <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16921367136/ode-to-my-messenger-bag">bag</a> would
get pretty heavy.</p>

<p>My writing process also involved a fair bit of paper as I would hand
write almost all my first drafts. It just felt more comfortable than
transferring my thoughts directly to a text file via keyboard, even
though it meant eventually typing up those drafts and having a
paper pad in my bag next to my iPad at all times.</p>

<p>Three things have happened that have allowed me to comfortably
transition the bulk of my previously paper-based work to the digital
world: iPad, cloud storage, and my new attitude toward writing. The iPad
lets me bring my research library with me and read it as if I were
reading paper. The screen and software are fast enough that annotation
feels natural, and it’s far easier to read in a variety of positions and
places than a laptop.  The cloud (in particular <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>) lets me
edit or annotate on any of my devices and have the results
automatically synchronized with all my other devices without my lifting
a finger.  I love
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2012/01/tip-for-getting-more-organized.html">technology that works for me rather than vice versa</a>.</p>

<p>My new attitude toward writing has nothing to do with hardware or
software and everything to do with the fact that I’m just writing more.
This includes blogging, writing handouts for classes, writing letters of
recommendation, writing referee reports for journals, and even
occasionally writing up my own research.  I’m getting more comfortable
composing on the computer through simple practice, and the fact that
the bulk of my writing is low-stakes has made the learning curve bearable.</p>

<p>Reading and annotation take place mostly on the iPad in GoodReader.
I’ve yet to see a pdf that it can’t handle and over the past two years
the annotation features have become better and better.  I’m still a
little slower on the iPad than I am scribbling on paper with a red pen,
but the advantages outweigh the current speed penalty. I don’t have to
carry 300 pages of paper around. I don’t have to make photo copies of
anything. I can distribute comments on papers via email as soon as
they’re ready.  Students don’t have to decipher my handwriting.  And
with practice I think I’ll get faster.  There are (several) other pdf
annotation apps for the iPad, but none of them (AFAIK) integrate as well
with Dropbox.  I can specify a folder and GoodReader will download all
the pdf’s in it so I have local copies.  Then, after I’ve made my
changes I just have to press the Sync button and the modified files are
uploaded.</p>

<p>The Preview app on the Mac has always allowed some pdf annotation, but
with the Lion release, it became excellent.  On a desktop monitor (or
two), I can blow up the text nice and big in one window and still have
room to see tables/figures in another.  With a real keyboard and a
healthy dose of keyboard shortcuts, I’m actually pretty fast at marking
up a document.  I’ve heard good things about <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/">Skim</a> as a Preview
replacement, and at some point I’ll give it a try.</p>

<p>For storage and searching, I use Mekentosj’s <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> app.  It integrates
with several online research databases (including ISI’s <a href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com">Web of
Knowledge</a>) and makes it very easy to slurp articles into my own libary.
I’ve also had some success with having it generate bibliographies for my
own papers.  But at the end of day, I spend a lot more time reading and
annotating with Preview or GoodReader that I do searching and organizing
in Papers.</p>

<p>New writing mostly happens on a Mac.  I continue to get faster at typing
on the iPad and iPhone, but I’m still way more efficient with a real
keyboard.  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> (<a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> to be specific) is my
editor-of-choice (as it has been for more than 20 years now) but I’ve
started using <a href="http://www.mindnode.com/">Mindnode</a> for initial brainstorming.  I’m not sure it
will stick, but it is fun.</p>

<p>My work world has a lot less paper in it than it did 6 months ago, but
I’m still not 100% paperless.  What’s left is mostly scraps, but there
are two things that I’d like to eventually transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Old articles:</strong>  I still have that big file cabinet full of articles
with notes.  Scanning them all or transcribing the notes would be a ton
of work that doesn’t seem worth it.  I could also just throw them away,
but storing them is pretty cheap.  And so for now they sit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lecture notes:</strong> I don’t like to put everything I’m going to say on
my lecture slides.  I think it’s confusing when students don’t know when
to listen to me or read the screen. Ideally, my slides just highlight the
organization and important points and include the occasional figure,
table, or dramatic photograph.  I tend to have a bunch of written notes
that go along with each lecture that I refer to while I’m talking or writing on
the board.  Slowly but surely I’m putting these notes into <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/why-markdown-a-two-minute-explanation/">Markdown</a>
documents that I can refer to while I teach, but for now I have a lot of
physical folders.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mostly paperless has been great for me because my bag is lighter and I
now have access to almost everything I need from almost everywhere.  It
makes sharing documents easier and I can index digital assets on
multiple dimensions.  Those debates about whether aricles should get
stored by author or by topic or by project are long gone since it’s easy
to do all three.  Paperless is also great for trees because they can
stay where they are soaking up sun and CO2 instead of being ground into
pulp and mixed with smelly chemicals.</p>

<p>100% paperless is kind of like enlightenment.  It’s extremely
hard (if not impossible) to achieve, but there are great rewards for
striving to get there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every couple weeks we go to the library after school.  Mostly we run
around and raise a ruckus because that’s what three-year-olds and
almost-one-year-olds do.  But we also gather up 15-20 new books to
peruse at home.  I’ve tried a lot of strategies for selecting them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Get all the books by a few authors we like.  This sometimes nets us
some surprises (Janell Cannon’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trupp-Fuzzhead-Tale-Janell-Cannon/dp/0152001301">Trupp</a>
is about a large earless cat who hangs out with the homeless) and some
stinkers (Don Freeman’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mop-Top-Don-Freeman/dp/1595190600">Moptop</a> is
about a kid who “needs” a haircut) but the main problem is we don’t
know enough good authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quickly make a random selection from a new part of the picture book
stacks.  More misses than hits but not so bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take most of the books the librarians have pulled out for display on
the tops of the shelves.  This works surprisingly well as the
librarians have better than random taste.  But I feel slightly
guilty—it’s like taking the clothes off the mannequins in a shop
window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these books at home (some several times) there are
always a few keepers that we have to order on Amazon.  Here are the
keepers from our most recent trip:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dahlia-Boston-Globe-Horn-Honors-Awards/dp/0374316783">Dahlia</a>
(by Barbara McClintock): I absolutely love everything about this book–Old
fashioned beautifully detailed line drawings and a story about a
tom-boy who gets a lacy doll as a gift from an aunt.  Great fun and
great message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Night-Paula-Wiseman-Books/dp/1416940057">Cat’s Night Out</a>
(by Caroline Stutson, illustrated by J. Klassen): A counting (by twos) book with tons of cute
dancing cats–the wife and kid love it though I prefer a bit more story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tinka-Rainy-Dohaney/dp/0689852614">Tinka</a> (by
  Rainy Dohaney): This story about a cupcake-sized sheep is only OK
  and the washed out art is nothing special.  But it’s still 4.5/5
  stars because it’s so quirky and R thinks it’s hilarious when the
  crow gets a worm wrapped around his head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Birthday-Presents-Rabbit-Hedgehog/dp/1842700359">The Birthday Presents</a>
(by Paul Stewart and Chris Ridell): Super-cute story about a rabbit and a
hedgehog with classic-looking pictures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There were also a few books that weren’t keepers but merit mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Root-Beer-Banana-Sarah-Sullivan/dp/0763617482">Root Beer and Banana</a>
(by Sarah Sullivan, illustrated by Greg Shed) is about a middle-class country girl and a
poor country girl who become friends over ice pops.  The art is
old-fashioned and I love how the poor girl is treated like a regular
person and not a sad museum exhibit.  But the stereotypes are a little
heavy handed–she’s kind of dirty with ratty clothes, she has no
nearby family, and she only has money she found in the street.  And
she can’t read so good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Priscilla-Pink-Planet-Nathaniel-Hobbie/dp/0316113492">Priscilla and the Pink Planet</a>
  (by Nathaniel Hobbie, illustrated by Jocelyn Hobbie)  has rhymes that are as close to
  Seuss as I’ve every read.  And the art is cute and so is the story.
  I’m not sure why I don’t like this book more.  Maybe it’s because
  the main character reminds me too much of Betty Boop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bracelet-Yoshiko-Uchida/dp/069811390X">The Bracelet</a>
(by Yoshiko Uchida): A picture book about the Japanese-American internment
during WW II.  Definitely not appropriate for a three year old.  A
little too much barbed wire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fly-Free-Roseanne-Thong/dp/1590785509">Fly Free!</a>
(by Roseanne Thong): I want to like this book.  It’s about Buddhist temples
in Vietnam and is all about doing nice things for other people.  The art is pretty.
But I really didn’t like that the temples were caging sparrows so that
people could pay them money to release them (and get good karma).  Can
we just not cage the birds to begin with please?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I went to <a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com/">a local shop</a> and
bought new tires for the mountain bike I ride around town almost every
day.  The angst I felt while deciding exactly what to buy took me by
surprise.  Part of me wanted something cheap and durable that would roll
smoothly and efficiently on pavement. But another part of me wanted to
replace my worn out racing tires with something aggressive, knobby and
impractical for city streets.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenties and thirties the bike I rode defined me more
than my sunglasses, my haircut, or my car. It was more than my
style—it was a major part of my identity. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but imagine what a truck guy’s truck means to him or what an
Apple nerd’s Mac means to him (or her).  A good friend of mine would
call me regularly and say “Got time for some tire talk?”  We would spend
the next half hour dissecting the pros and cons of different treads;
analyzing the tracks we saw out on the trails; debating whether Kevlar
worth the price premium; discussing trends like “thin on the bottom,
knobby on the sides”, and arguing about what tire shed mud or carved
corners best.  At the end though, the most important question was: “What
are you riding right now?”</p>

<p>Since I hit my forties my life has changed a lot.  I spend the vast
majority of my time working, parenting, or doing house stuff.  Trail
riding (and even trail-running) is mostly on hiatus.  My daylight
leisure time is almost always having fun with the girls and when they’re
sleeping at night I’d rather blog than ride.  In a few years (when the girls are
older) I’m sure I’ll be back, but until then, my riding will be limited
to the streets between my offices and classrooms.  This is far far
better than nothing–I actually love battling traffic and the elements.</p>

<p>So it’s been years since my bike’s gotten dirty, but up until last week,
I still had the option of veering onto any trail and cutting through East
Rock Park at a moment’s notice.  And I liked projecting the image of an
MTB guy on his way to a trailhead (even if I was wearing a corduroy
jacket).  Those days are over.  I chose a pair of
<a href="http://www.kendausa.com/en/home/bicycle/commuter.aspx">cheap tires</a>
that ride way better than my old knobbies on the road.  They even
have a little bit of a tread that could handle some of the East Rock
trails.  But now I’m honest with myself and world.  I’m a bike commuter.
It’s not permanent, but it’s true.  And I’m good with that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard that Apple announced a new iPad this week and that
they released a version of iPhoto that runs on iPads and iPhones. Most
folks seem to
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/07/iphoto-for-ios">like it quite a bit</a>,
while a few people have complained that it’s
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/iphoto-confusion/">unintuitive</a> with
all its mysterious icons and gestures.  The problems with Apple’s
“system” for managing and editing photos go much deeper and I find it
incredibly frustrating because Apple has all the pieces for something
truly fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Crappy About the Current System:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The new iPhoto doesn’t run on the original iPad. I get it that I’m in
the minority of people who like to buy a product and run into into the
ground before upgrading.  And I get it that it that some of the filters
might be a little slow.  But Adobe Photoshop Express runs well.  I think
their public reasoning is that the experience on my iPad would be
sub-par.  And it conveniently gives me another reason to upgrade.
Fine.  I’ll give Apple a pass on this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are Photos and iPhoto separate apps?  I would understand if
iPhoto had a superset of Photos’ features, but it doesn’t.  Photos
allows me to move photos between albums, create new albums, and do some
minor editing.  iPhoto has more powerful editing tools and lets me share
photos with friends in different ways, but it doesn’t manage albums.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any album management you do with Photos doesn’t get sync’ed back to
the desktop version of iPhoto.  So why would I possibly go to the
trouble of organizing my photos on the phone itself?  I would say this
was a bug, but it’s been there since iOS 5 was released in October.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photo Stream is a feature that doesn’t fit into my work flow.  I can
easily access all the photos I’ve taken over the last 30 days on any of
my devices.  If I want a photo that I took earlier than that, I must
have moved it someplace more permanent during that 30 day window or I
have to go back to the device where I took the picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t easily share photos between my Mac and my wife’s PC.  While
Apple might think this increases the chance that she will upgrade to a
Mac one of the days, this sort of thing just makes her dig her feet in
and resent the “Apple’s walled garden” even more than she already does.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Would Be a Lot Better:</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.  My perfect world looks more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto stores all my photos (and albums and events) in iCloud and
replicates them on my Mac.  Besides giving me a central repository that
I can access from anywhere, it’s also my off-site backup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto gets merged with the Photos app and it also accesses my photos
in iCloud.  This means any organization I do (e.g., moving photos
between albums) happens in one place: iCloud.  It also means that I
don’t have to actually store all the photos (and home video clips) on
the device itself—it can stream them as needed and manage a cache of
them so it seems fast.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apple provides a web app for browsing and organizing photos that
could be used from a PC.  Even better, they would open up the iCloud API
so someone could write a version of iPhoto for the PC that used the same
iCloud photo store, but that seems unlikely to happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photostream gets replaced by something simpler that just dumps all
photos taken by my devices into my iCloud photo store.  If they get
grouped as events (ala desktop iPhoto import) they’ll be easy to find
when I want to organize them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This dream system isn’t easy to build, but it’s not impossible either.
I just hope that Apple isn’t sitting there thinking their current system
is good enough or that it just needs a few minor tweeks.  And I really
hope that some improvements are in the pipeline.  If iOS 6 isn’t a lot
better, I might just have to switch my photo management to Google
Picasa.  And this Apple fan-boi certainly doesn’t want to do that.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-03-05T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 5<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Beatles played mostly sugary upbeat pop songs.  They have <em>at least
three</em> songs about good mornings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They sang that “All You Need is
Love” and “Octopus’s Garden” and “Yellow Submarine”.  The whole band
spent time in India getting in tune with their spiritual sides.  John
went on to “imagine all the people living life in peace” while Paul sang
“Ebony and Ivory” with Stevie Wonder.</p>

<p>All that’s true.  And so is the fact that they had a creepy obsession
with violence against women and serial killers.  It all started in 1965
with <em>Rubber Soul</em>’s final track: “Run for Your Life”.  I’ll lyrics
speak for themselves:</p>

<pre>
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man 
That's the end'a little girl
</pre>

<p>They followed this in 1967 with Sgt. Pepper’s “Getting Better”.  I loved
this song when I was a kid and thought nothing of these lines:</p>

<pre>
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart 
  from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, things were not getting better.  In 1968 the Beatles
released the White Album which was full of songs that went on to inspire
renowned serial killer Charles Manson.  The lyrics to Manson’s favorite
song (“Helter Skelter”) are a little opaque (e.g., “When I get to the
bottom I go back to the top of the slide”) but Manson sure knew what
they meant.</p>

<p>And finally, on the last album they recorded together (<em>Abbey Road</em>),
the Beatles transparently glamourized a serial killer named Maxwell
Edison who by the end of the song bludgeons to death two women and a
male magistrate:</p>

<pre>
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
</pre>

<p>The Beatles were an incredibly talented and versatile band.  They’ve
inspired countless musicians over the years.  Perhaps it’s time to give
them credit for inspiring some 1990’s sicko metal (and nü-metal)
bands like Slayer and Korn too.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-04T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 4<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It turns out there is a lot of confusion out there about what exactly
professors do over spring break. My neighbors think I’m on my way to the
beach and my students don’t know what to think. So let’s put this
mystery to rest with a top 10 list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Catch up on research. During the semester if you have a less than
productive research day there are no short term consequences.  On the
other hand, if you don’t prep you lecture for the next day you look
pretty silly standing up in front of your class with nothing to
say. That’s a recipe for falling behind on research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grade the exams students took the week before break and the
papers students passed in right before they left for Daytona.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write referee reports. Part of our job is to evaluate our peers’ work and
either suggest improvements or make the case that the project is
hopeless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attend conferences.  These are often conveniently scheduled when we
don’t have to work around classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect data in the field. I don’t do much of this, but if I did,
this is when I’d do it. Preferably someplace warm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recover some sleep. We don’t get enough during the semester either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See family. These might be members in our own homes that we didn’t
see enough or grandparents that live in another state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prep classes for after break. It’s always nice to start the second
half with a few lectures in the bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>File taxes. If you’re extremely lucky you have another professor in
your household that’s willing to do this.  (Thank you!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blog a little more. We can always dream!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So is spring break vacation?  Kind of, but not really since we work almost
every day.  It’s still nice change of pace.</p>
