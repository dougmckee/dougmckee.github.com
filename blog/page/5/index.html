  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year or so I get cranky about my task management system and switch
to something new.  This year it’s particularly bad because I’ve been
hearing the Siren Song of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.  I swear every nerd blogger I read
uses it: e.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/08/omnifocus-v-things-mac-ipad-iphone/">The Brooks Review</a></li>
  <li>David Sparks at <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/7/30/ipad-omnifocus-review.html">MacSparky</a></li>
  <li>Aleh Cherp at <a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2012/04/02/task-management-with-omnifocus-collecting-and-processing/">Macademic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I even believe John Gruber (<a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>) uses it though he’s a
little cagy since they are often a sponsor of his.</p>

<p>BUT, I strongly believe you shouldn’t switch systems unless you’re
solving specific problems.  That is, I invest in my systems and don’t
want to switch just for fun.  Hearing that some other piece of software
is “really good” or even “better” than what you’re currently using
isn’t good enough for me.</p>

<p>Last year when I made the switch from <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a> to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>
(RTM), I had some clear requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cross-platform</em>: I was spending time on Mac, Windows, iPad, and
 iPhone and I needed to be able to access my tasks from all of them.</li>
  <li><em>Rock solid invisible sync</em>: I never wanted to think about which
 version of my task list I was working with.  There should be just one
 master copy (preferably in the cloud) that gets seemlessly accessed
 and updated from various clients.</li>
  <li><em>Power and flexibility</em>: Google Tasks met the first two criteria, but it was just too
 simple.  I wanted more than due dates and separate lists.  I wanted
 to be able to attach priorities, contexts, durations, and other
 arbitrary tags.  I wanted to  dynamically create lists based on
 these characteristics that showed me just what I wanted (and was
 able) to do at any particular moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time, RTM was the best solution, but the world has changed since
then.  Omnifocus now provides highly regarded Sync Services.  And I’ve
shed my need for Windows now that I carry a MacBook Air with me
everywhere i go.</p>

<p>Stepping up a level for a moment, the overall task management system you
use is far more important than the particular tool you use to implement
it.  I’m a GTD (Getting Things Done) guy, though I’m not the most
orthodox devotee you’ll meet.  There are two things I love about GTD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You get the mental to do list out of your head.  Since you’re not
constantly worrying that you’ll forget something, your mind is freed up
for more interesting creative work.  And you’re not forgetting things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once your tasks are organized, GTD provides a way to quickly see what
you can and should be doing in any given context.  This is exactly what
I couldn’t do with Google Tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After a year of experience (and tweeking), I’ve got an implementation of
my GTD system in Remember The Milk that works pretty well.  Before
casting it aside for a new pretty young thing, I’m going to describe my
system and what works and doesn’t work for me.  It’s almost certainly
not a perfect match for anyone else, but it might give you ideas for
things to try or think about.  </p>

<p>RTM is a simple system that lets you build complex systems on top of it.
Basically, you just define a bunch of lists of tasks with
characteristics.  These characteristics include priorities, due dates,
durations, locations, and arbitrary tags–exactly what I want.  The
power comes from defining Smart Lists that are basically saved searches
based on these characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Even though RTM supports multiple lists, I keep almost all my tasks in
the Inbox list and use other lists only for storing things like books
I’d like to read or ideas for upcoming posts.  I define my projects with
tags.  Home-related projects have tags starting with “ph-“ (e.g.,
“ph-basement”) and work-related projects have tags starting with “pw-“.
Most tasks that go into the system have either a project assigned or a simple
“work” tag.  If it’s a single task home project, I don’t take the time
to assign a project tag at all.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>I assign each task a single location tag: at-desk, at-phone, at-home,
at-econoffice, at-errand, or at-wife.  The last one is special: tasks
that require consultation with my wife.  Someone else that runs a lot of
errands might find it worth their time to set up several locations that
cause tasks to pop up when they go somewhere, but generally I go
somewhere <em>because</em> I need to do something and so don’t need to get
reminded.</p>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p>Coming up with the right set of contexts is critical to the system and
it’s the hardest part. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">The GTD Book</a>, David Allen talks a lot about home,
office, and phone. With smart phones, the set of things you can do “on
the phone” is far larger than it used to be.  Since I usually have my
laptop with me and most of my resources are online, home office,
work office, and even cafe are almost the same.</p>

<p>Right now I have four smart lists that define my contexts:</p>

<p><strong>c-working</strong> </p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (list:Inbox and (tagContains:pw- or
tag:work or tag:weekday) and (dueWithin:"5 days of today" or
priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the context I look at during the work day or at night when
I’m working.  It includes everything due today or that’s overdue so I
don’t miss deadlines.  It also includes any tasks associated with
work-related projects or that can only be done during the week
(<tt>tag:weekday</tt>).  The most interesting piece is where I drop all
tasks that are due more than five days from now that have no priority
assigned.  These are the tasks I don’t even want to think about until it
gets closer to their due date.</p>

<p><strong>c-weekend</strong></p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (not tag:work and not
tagContains:pw- and not tag:weekday and list:Inbox and (dueWithin:"5
days of today" or priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On weekends and any time I want to focus on the non-work part of my
life I check this list.  It’s almost the inverse of my work context
except that it also includes anything that’s due or past due.</p>

<p><strong>c-out</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:at-errand or tag:at-phone
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I should and can do when I’m out and about.</p>

<p><strong>c-easy</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:fun or tag:easy or timeEstimate:"&lt; 1 hour"
</code></pre>

<p>When I’m tired or just have a few minutes, I look at this list.  It’s my
newest context, and I might eventually break it into a tired list and a
separate quick-task list.  </p>

<p>All four of these Smart Lists are sorted first by due date and then by
priority.  I often use <strong>high priority</strong> to mark that a task is the
next action for a project.  This way it’s always listed before other
actions that I want to record but might not be ready to do.  A while
back I read <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">another article</a> about implementing GTD in RTM and it
suggested using an <strong>na</strong> tag.  My system allows me to complete a task
for a project and have the other tasks still show up on the list.  The
last thing I want to do is to constantly be tagging new tasks as <strong>na</strong>
as I complete other tasks.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when I want to focus on a particular project
and in those cases I simply look at the Tag view for the project and
see all the tasks associated with the project no matter when they are
due or what their priority.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly Review:</h2>

<p>Just as David Allen says, I’ve found that if I don’t do a weekly review,
the information in the system drifts away from the information in my
brain and loses its value.  That’s when most folks fall off the wagon.
So support for the weekly review process is super-important.  Here’s
what I do every week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at my untagged Smart List (<tt>not isTagged:true list:Inbox</tt>)
and assign project (if necessary) or location tags</li>
  <li>Look at the tasks for each project:
    <ul>
      <li>Are any upcoming tasks missing?  </li>
      <li>Are priorities and due dates right?</li>
      <li>Can I delete any tasks that are no longer needed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any new projects that didn’t make it into the system during the week</li>
  <li>Quickly look at all the tasks in the system (usually between 100 and 150)
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need to lower / raise any priorities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look at what I accomplished in last week (<tt>completedWithin:”1 week
of today”</tt>)–good for setting feasible future expectations </li>
</ul>

<p>One nice thing about this way of doing weekly reviews is that it can be
done in chunks here and there –I don’t have to set aside the
traditional 2-3 hour block.</p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>

<p>On the whole, I’m pretty happy with my system, but that doesn’t mean
there’s not lots of room for improvement.  </p>

<p>First, my system isn’t that great for capturing or doing long range
planning.  I can’t specify task dependencies and I can’t even specify
start dates for tasks.  If I could, that would let me filter out tasks
that I know I’m not starting for a while.  I try to follow orthodox GTD
practice and only use due dates for when things are really due. That way
I don’t miss these things in a sea of stuff that I’d like to be done on
that day.</p>

<p>Second, while the iOS apps are very good, I’m getting tired of the
clunky RTM web interface.  It’s functional, but pretty ugly.   I use
Fluid to make RTM a pop down menubar app, but I can’t get it to play
well with multiple Spaces.  That is, when I pop down the app, it pulls
me back to the Space I first started it.  And when RTM automatically
logs me out of the website (more often than I’d like), 
<a href="http://support.agilebits.com/discussions/1password-38-for-mac-from-agilebits-website/11718-1password-with-fluid">I can’t use 1Password to log back bin</a>.  I’m still totally dumbfounded that
no one has built a decent native Mac app for the service.</p>

<p>Third, entering new tasks requires me to click on the menubar app and
then put the cursor in the new task text entry box.  It sure would be
nice to have a global hot key for this.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Remember The Milk bugs me, but it also works for me.  And maybe
Omnifocus wouldn’t be uniformly better.  I’m worried that it would
try to force me into new ways of doing things that just don’t match my
work flow.  Maybe instead I need to check out <a href="http://donaldjenkins.com/2012/02/why-i-switched-from-omnifocus-to-things/">Things</a>….  Or maybe I
just need to get back to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been times in my life when I’ve listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I’m pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get—that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don’t feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I’ve started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I’m as surprised as you are as I’ve always been an “I don’t like
country” guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I’m not totally sure what’s changed, but over the last few weeks
I’ve Shazamed several songs that I’ve had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">“Country Must Be Country Wide”</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it’s so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80’s.  It’s got awesome guitar and great lines like
“In every state there’s a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon”.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">“Got My Country On”</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is “Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars”.  He
even says he’s “Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">“This”</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn’t be more earnest: “Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this.”  I’ve never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">“Drink On It”</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It’s about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this will country thing be a fad for me.  Or maybe I’ll be wearing Wranglers and
cowboy boots by this time next year.  I’ll definitely pass on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/smokeless">Skoal</a> though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve always wanted to live life efficiently.  When I was in third grade
I made a list of all the chores I had to do every morning (like make the
bed) and timed myself doing them. I even made my mom assign quality
grades to each task to make sure I wasn’t sacrificing on that margin for
speed.</p>

<p>I don’t make my bed anymore, but I do grade a lot of papers and I like
to give copious feedback. The returns to optimizing this process are
big. That’s why I recently decided to try out several iPad PDF
annotation apps to find the one that best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>My needs aren’t extreme. I mostly want to highlight, strike-through, and
add colored text. Occasionally I want to underline, add a long note, or
draw a shape. And since all my documents live on Dropbox, I want to
easily sync whole folders. It turns out there are at least three apps
that can do all of these things, but they have some important
differences in how they get there.  Here’s what I’ve found:</p>

<h2 id="goodreader-314"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">GoodReader 3.14</a></h2>

<p>GoodReader has been my go-to annotation app for the last six months, and
it sets the bar high.  The only real annoyance is that you have to enter
inline comments (i.e., use the typewriter tool) in a popup editing
window before the app drops your words into the document.  Once
there, it’s easy to grab the comment (by holding a finger on it) and
move or resize the text box.  This is critical since you never know
exactly where or how big the text box will be.  You don’t have any
control over the font for these inline comments and the one it chooses
is cheesy typewriter, but I don’t mind.</p>

<p>Syncing folders with Dropbox is great although the sync button can get
hidden way down in in the “Web Downloads” area are under a long list of
“recent” downloads.  In fact, the whole document management interface is
functional, but messy and unintuitive–i.e., once you know your way
around, you don’t waste a lot of time, but it’s never pretty and there
is a learning curve.</p>

<p>One useful feature I haven’t found in the other apps is a Back button
under the scroll bar that (obviously) puts you back where you were after
you scroll somewhere else or move to a bookmark.  This is great when
you’re flipping between text and tables.</p>

<h2 id="iannotate-pdf-21"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953">iAnnotate PDF 2.1</a></h2>

<p>iAnnotate PDF has a clunky name and a cartoony interface.  I think it’s
been around the longest and it’s extremely configurable.  People who use
it swear it does everything they want but it takes a little work up
front to set it up.  I believe them.  And when you add inline text, you
do it in the page itself which is much more natural than typing into GoodReader’s
disembodied text box.</p>

<p>On the downside, it’s been crashy for me.  I’ve been using an original
iPad, so maybe it’s more stable on newer hardware.  It doesn’t have a
scroll bar that lets you move directly to the end (or beginning) of your
document.  It doesn’t always highlight the spaces between words and I
can’t get it to autocorrect when using the typewriter tool.  But even if
these things got fixed, I just find the ugly icons too distracting.</p>

<h2 id="pdf-expert-40"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">PDF Expert 4.0</a></h2>

<p>Ah, we have a winner!  PDF Expert is a breath of fresh air.  It has
everything I like about GoodReader (except the back button) in a package
that’s just beautiful to look at.  The document management UI is
super-clean, fast, and intuitive.  It even gives you thumbnails of the
first page of each document.  The icons in the document annotation UI
are simple and classy.  When browsing a pdf, the page turns are very
fast.</p>

<p>On top of this, I don’t know how I lived without PDF Expert’s  undo and
redo commands.  They not only keep you from inadvertently junking up
your document, it means the UI doesn’t ever ask “Are you really
sure?” when you delete something because you can always roll back to the
previous state.  </p>

<p>What’s not to like?  Some people complain that it only opens one
document at a time, but I find opening and closing to be fast
enough that this isn’t a big deal.  My biggest complaint (and it’s
minor) is that you only have 9 colors to choose from for markup and
they’re kind of brash.  It’s like they were inspired by the available
colors for Apple’s <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/95875/which-smart-cover-to-get-get-a-polyurethane-one-heres-why/">cheap Smart Covers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">PDFpen</a> has been around for quite a while on the Mac, and if Preview
wasn’t as good as it was, I’d probably be using it there.  But on the
iPad, it’s the new kid on the block.  None of the positive reviews on
the app store compares it with the big three, and a few negative reviews
say it’s crashy and has fewer features.  It will probably improve over
time, but considering it costs the most ($15) and seemingly does the
least, I’m skipping it for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">Notability</a> is really a note-taking app that can also annotate PDF’s.
When I’m in a meeting or seminar, I usually use Nebulous Notes and type
right into a text file.  If I have a copy of the slides or the paper
being presented, I now take my notes right on them with PDF Expert.
Notability is particularly strong with drawing, but I find even with my
Cosmonaut stylus, the lag between moving the pen and seeing my picture
is just too unnatural to replace pen and paper.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>PDF Expert is fantastic.  I’m so glad I went through this exercise and
have graduated from GoodReader!  Of course, I could have just read Cynical
Babblings’ <a href="http://cynicalbabblings.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/pdf-editing-apps-2012-review/">recent review</a> of same apps.  I found it while I was
in the middle of my evaluation process, and he’s much more thorough than
I am.  And he also likes PDF Expert best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most grown-ups, even those without kids, have heard of Eric Carle—He is
an extremely popular children’s book author who illustrates using
collage.  In fact, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Bear-What-You-See/dp/0805047905">Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do See</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Hungry-Caterpillar-Eric-Carle/dp/0399226907">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> have now supplanted Margaret Wise Brown’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0694003611">Goodnight Moon</a> as the standard gift for newborn kids.</p>

<p>Both my daughters celebrated Eric Carle week at school last month
and it got me thinking (again) just how over-rated he is.  He’s
either today’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> or the kids’ version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinkade">Thomas Kinkade</a>
(“Painter of Light”).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  With a few exceptions (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Birthday-Message-Board-Book/dp/0694011487">The Secret Birthday Message</a>), his books couldn’t be more repetitive and formulaic.</p>

<p>I’m not saying his books have no redeeming qualities—the pictures are
pretty and they do appeal to the 1-2 year old crowd. But thats not
exactly the most demanding audience and his collage style isn’t even
unique. Leo Lionni started publishing picture books with collage back in
1959 and Lois Ehlert won a Caldecott in 1989 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Board-Book-Lois-Ehlert/dp/0694010677">Color Zoo</a>.</p>

<p>Leo Lionni in particular deserves far more attention than he gets. The
only good thing about many of his books being out of print is that it
made it slightly easier to pick four Lionni books to send to my sister’s
family for Christmas.</p>

<p>Lionni was a late bloomer as a children’s book author as he had a full
career as a “real” artist before writing
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Blue-Yellow-Leo-Lionni/dp/0688132855">Little Blue and Little Yellow</a>. His stories are quirky and many push
the envelope on what’s possible in a kids’ book.  And every one has a
positive message.  For example in his first book, the characters are
splotches of color who get mixed up and turn green.  Their parents don’t
recognize them until they cry themselves apart, but then the parents recognize
their mistake and learn not to be so judgmental.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flea-Story-Leo-Lionni/dp/0905478266">A Flea Story</a>, you never even see the main characters. Instead you
only hear a dialog that’s reminiscent of Herman Hesse’s odd couple
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Narcissus-Goldmund-Hermann-Hesse/dp/B003NQOS4M">Narcissus and Goldmund</a>. One flea just wants to stay home on their
dog’s butt while the other longs for adventure. They travel together for
a while and then split to follow their own paths. Stories that appeal to
both adults and children are rare and those that do usually have two
sets of jokes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a> is the classic example). Lionni
manages to make the same things funny to all ages.</p>

<p>One of R’s favorite Lioni stories is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matthews-Dream-Leo-Lionni/dp/067987318X">Matthew’s Dream</a>. Matthew is a poor
mouse who visits a museum with his school and is inspired to be an
artist. He dreams fantastic versions of his mundane world and paints
them into reality.  Often when R paints her own pictures she says “I’m
Matthew!”</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0394829115">Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</a>, Alexander yearns to be a windup
mouse who is loved by the family instead of hated and chased with a
broom. He finds a magical lizard who will grant him his wish in exchange
for a purple pebble.  By the time he acquires one, the world has changed
and he learns to be careful what he wishes for.  R still looks for
purple pebbles to give to the lizard.</p>

<p>My one year old does like flipping through Eric Carle board books, but
as soon as she will sit still and let us read to her, she’s graduating to
Leo Lionni. The pictures are even more beautiful, the stories are
awesome, and the whole family can enjoy the ride.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>My wife thinks it’s a cheap shot comparing Carle to Kinkade, but I
never miss a chance to bring up my favorite abusive alcoholic
religious nut-job artist, even if he did pass away recently.  And the
truth is, I think his work is pretty.  Just like Eric Carle’s.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The main goal of our biweekly trip to the New Haven Free Public Library is to
pick 20 or so great picture books.  I’m looking for books with beautiful
art, lovable (or at least memorable) characters, an original story, and
a positive message.  These books are rare and they’re difficult to
identify by a book spine, a book cover, or even a quick perusal.  And I
don’t have time for much more than that.</p>

<p>So the failure rate is high, but in this case failing isn’t all that bad
an outcome.  In fact, most books that come home succeed on at least one
dimension.  Sometimes the books are so spectacularly awful or
inappropriate that they stretch your brain.  And often R’s favorite
books are not my favorites.  The bottom line is that we both get a fair
amount out of reading the mediocre bulk of our haul, even when most get
returned never to be read again.</p>

<p>Our latest keepers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Umbrella-Queen-Shirin-Bridges/dp/0060750405">The Umbrella Queen</a> (by Shirin Yim Bridges, illustrated by Taeeun
  Yoo) I have a special place in my heart for atypical stories
  that take place in other countries.  And even better, I
  like stories about kids who are true to themselves.  This book takes
  place in Thailand and follows a girl whose inner artist cannot
  be squashed.  It reminds me a lot of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Empty-Pot-Demi/dp/0805082271">The Empty Pot</a>(by
  Demi) and I Ioved
  that too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Library-Lion-Michelle-Knudsen/dp/076363784X">Library Lion</a> (by Michelle Knudsen, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes) The
  lesson here is fantastic: Rules are good, but there are always
  extenuating circumstances when they should be broken.  The premise is
  absurd (a friendly helpful lion hangs out at the library) but not
  totally drug-addled (see
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hogula-Dread-Night-Jean-Gralley/dp/0805071644/">Hogula: the Dread Pig of the Night</a> (by
  Jean Gralley) for an
  example of the latter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Worker-Kate-Banks/dp/0374400008">The Night Worker</a> (by Kate Banks, illustrated by Georg Hallensleben)
A respectful portrayal of a Latino engineer who takes a son to the job
site one night.  Lots of construction equipment and beautiful almost
Gauguin-style paintings.  What’s not to love?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Dragon-Kate-Banks/dp/B003IWYJIG">Max’s Dragon</a>by Kate Banks, illustrated by Boris Kulikov) This
story is about two (older?) brothers playing croquet and their quirky
(younger?) brother who has a big imagination and loves rhymes.
Super-cute and super-original and the art is good though not my
favorite style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polar-Bear-Easy---Read-Puffin/dp/0140386920">A Polar Bear Can Swim</a> (by Harriet Ziefert, illustrated by Emily
Bolam) This book is designed for kids who are learning to read on
their own and who are curious about animals and science.  That’s a
perfect match for R.  It’s filled with fun facts (“A cow can drink 75
gallons of water in a day!”) and simple artwork.  I’m excited to check out
other members of the Viking Science Easy-to-Read series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balloons-Dee-Lillegard/dp/0525459405">Balloons Balloons Balloons</a> (by Dee Lillegard, illustrated by
Bernadette Pons) I admit I find this book a little brain-numbing, but
R is going to love any book that has a rabbit in a hot air balloon
dumping huge numbers of multicolored balloons on a whole town.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-River-Marjorie-Kinnan-Rawlings/dp/1416911790">The Secret River</a> (by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, illustrated by Leo
and Diane Dillon) This book is special.  It was written in 1947 by the
author of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yearling-Aladdin-Classics-Marjorie-Rawlings/dp/0689846231">The Yearling</a>
and it follows a poor black girl who lives in the rural South in the
early part of the 20th century.  I don’t have a lot of experience with
this environment, but it sure seems real to me.  The art is great and
the story is magical in a way that works for adults and children.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Honorable mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ginger-Bear-Mini-Grey/dp/0375842535">Ginger Bear</a> (by Mini Grey) R and I both like the part where Horace
smears cookie dough all over the toilet seat, but it goes downhill
from there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Really-Rabbits-Virginia-L-Kroll/dp/157091897X">Really Rabbits</a> (by Virginia Kroll, illustrated by Philomena
O’Neill) Cute story about two pet rabbits who do household chores in
the middle of the night.  We could use these guys in our house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Classic-Read-Book/dp/0061885177">Wonder Woman: I am Wonder Woman</a> (by Eric K. Stein, illustrated by
Rick Farley) An adaptation of a comic book?  Really? Yes!  Wonder Woman is a
positive role model for girls and R loves her tiara and bracelets.
And it doesn’t hurt that Dad had a thing for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Carter#Wonder_Woman">Linda Carter</a>
when he was in high school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Tour-Jarrett-Krosoczka/dp/0375833439">Punk Farm On Tour</a> (by Jarrett J. Krosoczka) It’s really quite good,
but if you already have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Jarrett-J-Krosoczka/dp/0440417937">Punk Farm</a> you’re not getting a whole lot
more here.  If you don’t have <em>Punk Farm</em> yet, you need to run out and
get it right away!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tricycle-Elisa-Amado/dp/0888996144">Tricycle</a> (by Elisa Amado, illustrated by Alfonso Ruano) A girl from
a wealthy family in Guatemala is friends with three poor kids next
door.  She sees them steal her tricycle but doesn’t say anything to
her parents because she knows she shouldn’t have left it in the bushes
and she already has a lot more stuff than they have.  I love the complex
emotions and the interplay of personal relationships and the gulf
between rich and poor that exists pretty much everywhere but is
especially stark in Latin America.  All of this is lost on R, but
she’s 3.  I’m not so sure she’ll get it at 5 either, but I commend the
authors for trying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When most people think of labs, they imagine scientists in white coats
staring into microscopes, carrying around beakers of bubbling chemicals, 
and holding test tubes over Bunsen burners.  In social science, the
reality is much more mundane.  It’s usually just a room full of
computers with software that may or may not be useful and may or may not
be up to date.  Even less compelling are the labs associated with
statistical methods classes.  The last couple years my own classes have
been the worst case scenario–I just get up and lecture about how my
students should use some particular piece of software to apply the
methods we’ve been learning in the “lecture” part of the class.  It
doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

<p>Over the next few months I will have the opportunity to teach two new
methods classes and completely re-invent how I incorporate labs.  I had
lunch with <a href="http://publichealth.yale.edu/cde/people/mayur_desai.profile">Mayur Desai</a> the other day and I think he does a great job
with labs in his classes and he’s inspired most (but not all) of the
ideas here.  This is what I’m thinking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>No lectures.  None.  Students enter the lab and get their assignment
    and spend the rest of the class trying to complete it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each assignment starts with a data set (preferably real) and a
    blank screen–that is, I don’t give them any code.  Their job is to
    answer a substantive question by applying methods we’ve covered
    recently to the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students work in pairs and take turns driving.  I think this keeps
    students focused and they can teach each other.  It also means only
    half the class has to have laptops if I want to implement a lab in a
    regular classroom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m around to answer questions.  In this way, it’s very different
    from a problem set where getting stuck on something dumb for hours
    at a time is a common occurrence.  Struggling with problem is good
    for learning, but banging your head against a wall isn’t an
    efficient use of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end product should be similar to results they might find
  in a published paper.  Sometimes I’ll provide an empty table they must
  fill in and other times they will produce their own tables of results
  from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be opportunities for quicker/more advanced students to
  do more.  One size does not fit all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While it’s possible to use any statistical analysis tool in a lab
successfully, I do think some packages are better than others.  Most
students already know Microsoft Excel and doing basic analyses (even
regression) using it is easy, but you really hit a wall when you want to
do anything even a little sophisticated.  SAS is powerful, but there is
a steep learning curve.  My plan is to use Stata.  You can browse your
data in a spreadsheet style interface.  You can play with commands
through the menus and when you choose one, it shows you the command-line
equivalent.  You can work interactively at the command-line or build
programs (using those same commands) in an editor.  And the
documentation is excellent and available online.</p>

<p>I’ll let you know how it goes!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago the girls and I went to the
<a href="http://peabody.yale.edu/">Peabody Natural History Musem</a> and learned that salamanders
and newts are very common animals in Connecticut.  The reason you never
see them is that they mostly hang out in places we don’t go.  Reading a
little further, I learned that the best chance for an encounter is near
water on a rainy early spring night.  </p>

<p>Last week R and I were reading one of our favorite poetry books
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Boatman-Caldecott-Ribbon-Nonfiction/dp/0618135472">Song of the Water Boatman and Other Pond Poems</a>) and I noticed that
it said early spring nights were a great time to hear peepers—these
tiny tree frogs congregate around ponds and to attract mates with their
calls.  I’d never heard peepers, but it sounded pretty cool.</p>

<p>Then yesterday evening, when the weather forecast told me it was going to be
our last rainy night for at least a week, I decided R and I needed to take a
quick trip to the neighborhood pond.  We got our rain boots,
rain coats, umbrellas, and flash lights and hopped into the car.  “Are
you excited?” I asked?  “Oh yes, very excited!” R replied.</p>

<p>We arrived at the trail head and while the batteries in my big maglight
were almost dead, R’s flashlight saved the day.  We tromped along and
quickly heard our first peepers!  They got quieter as we approached the
pond, so we turned off our lights and only talked in whispers.  Within a
minute, a peeper on the other side resumed calling.  We both thought it
was fantastic.</p>

<p>On the way back to the car we looked for salamanders and newts but came
up empty.  We also learned that balancing on wet logs in the rain
wearing rubber boots is harder than it looks.  At home we did some quick
Easter egg coloring and got ready for bed.  R was super excited to when
Mom suggested she wear her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carters-Hearts-Fleece-Sleeper-Pajamas/dp/B00719YPJA">Peeper jammies</a>.  </p>

<p>The whole trip lasted 30 minutes, but our memories will last a lifetime.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-30T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 30<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love paper—wrapping paper, home made greeting cards, paper mâché
piñatas, a good coffee table book, any <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Wonderful-Wizard-Oz-Commemorative/dp/0689817517">Sabuda pop up book</a>, origami,
even (especially?) paper airplanes—it all makes me happy.  And up until
recently, paper played a big role in my workflow.  I read a lot of
research articles and generally, I would print them and write all over
them.  The act of taking notes forces me to engage and extract much more
than I would if I were passively reading.  These hand-annotated articles
would go into my file cabinet so I could refer to my notes next time I
read the article.  I also grade about 100 student papers per semester
and like to provide copious feedback.  Since my work days are spread
between two or three campus offices and a home office, my <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16921367136/ode-to-my-messenger-bag">bag</a> would
get pretty heavy.</p>

<p>My writing process also involved a fair bit of paper as I would hand
write almost all my first drafts. It just felt more comfortable than
transferring my thoughts directly to a text file via keyboard, even
though it meant eventually typing up those drafts and having a
paper pad in my bag next to my iPad at all times.</p>

<p>Three things have happened that have allowed me to comfortably
transition the bulk of my previously paper-based work to the digital
world: iPad, cloud storage, and my new attitude toward writing. The iPad
lets me bring my research library with me and read it as if I were
reading paper. The screen and software are fast enough that annotation
feels natural, and it’s far easier to read in a variety of positions and
places than a laptop.  The cloud (in particular <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>) lets me
edit or annotate on any of my devices and have the results
automatically synchronized with all my other devices without my lifting
a finger.  I love
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2012/01/tip-for-getting-more-organized.html">technology that works for me rather than vice versa</a>.</p>

<p>My new attitude toward writing has nothing to do with hardware or
software and everything to do with the fact that I’m just writing more.
This includes blogging, writing handouts for classes, writing letters of
recommendation, writing referee reports for journals, and even
occasionally writing up my own research.  I’m getting more comfortable
composing on the computer through simple practice, and the fact that
the bulk of my writing is low-stakes has made the learning curve bearable.</p>

<p>Reading and annotation take place mostly on the iPad in GoodReader.
I’ve yet to see a pdf that it can’t handle and over the past two years
the annotation features have become better and better.  I’m still a
little slower on the iPad than I am scribbling on paper with a red pen,
but the advantages outweigh the current speed penalty. I don’t have to
carry 300 pages of paper around. I don’t have to make photo copies of
anything. I can distribute comments on papers via email as soon as
they’re ready.  Students don’t have to decipher my handwriting.  And
with practice I think I’ll get faster.  There are (several) other pdf
annotation apps for the iPad, but none of them (AFAIK) integrate as well
with Dropbox.  I can specify a folder and GoodReader will download all
the pdf’s in it so I have local copies.  Then, after I’ve made my
changes I just have to press the Sync button and the modified files are
uploaded.</p>

<p>The Preview app on the Mac has always allowed some pdf annotation, but
with the Lion release, it became excellent.  On a desktop monitor (or
two), I can blow up the text nice and big in one window and still have
room to see tables/figures in another.  With a real keyboard and a
healthy dose of keyboard shortcuts, I’m actually pretty fast at marking
up a document.  I’ve heard good things about <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/">Skim</a> as a Preview
replacement, and at some point I’ll give it a try.</p>

<p>For storage and searching, I use Mekentosj’s <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> app.  It integrates
with several online research databases (including ISI’s <a href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com">Web of
Knowledge</a>) and makes it very easy to slurp articles into my own libary.
I’ve also had some success with having it generate bibliographies for my
own papers.  But at the end of day, I spend a lot more time reading and
annotating with Preview or GoodReader that I do searching and organizing
in Papers.</p>

<p>New writing mostly happens on a Mac.  I continue to get faster at typing
on the iPad and iPhone, but I’m still way more efficient with a real
keyboard.  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> (<a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> to be specific) is my
editor-of-choice (as it has been for more than 20 years now) but I’ve
started using <a href="http://www.mindnode.com/">Mindnode</a> for initial brainstorming.  I’m not sure it
will stick, but it is fun.</p>

<p>My work world has a lot less paper in it than it did 6 months ago, but
I’m still not 100% paperless.  What’s left is mostly scraps, but there
are two things that I’d like to eventually transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Old articles:</strong>  I still have that big file cabinet full of articles
with notes.  Scanning them all or transcribing the notes would be a ton
of work that doesn’t seem worth it.  I could also just throw them away,
but storing them is pretty cheap.  And so for now they sit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lecture notes:</strong> I don’t like to put everything I’m going to say on
my lecture slides.  I think it’s confusing when students don’t know when
to listen to me or read the screen. Ideally, my slides just highlight the
organization and important points and include the occasional figure,
table, or dramatic photograph.  I tend to have a bunch of written notes
that go along with each lecture that I refer to while I’m talking or writing on
the board.  Slowly but surely I’m putting these notes into <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/why-markdown-a-two-minute-explanation/">Markdown</a>
documents that I can refer to while I teach, but for now I have a lot of
physical folders.</p>

<p>Mostly paperless has been great for me because my bag is lighter and I
now have access to almost everything I need from almost everywhere.  It
makes sharing documents easier and I can index digital assets on
multiple dimensions.  Those debates about whether aricles should get
stored by author or by topic or by project are long gone since it’s easy
to do all three.  Paperless is also great for trees because they can
stay where they are soaking up sun and CO2 instead of being ground into
pulp and mixed with smelly chemicals.</p>

<p>100% paperless is kind of like enlightenment.  It’s extremely
hard (if not impossible) to achieve, but there are great rewards for
striving to get there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every couple weeks we go to the library after school.  Mostly we run
around and raise a ruckus because that’s what three-year-olds and
almost-one-year-olds do.  But we also gather up 15-20 new books to
peruse at home.  I’ve tried a lot of strategies for selecting them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Get all the books by a few authors we like.  This sometimes nets us
some surprises (Janell Cannon’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trupp-Fuzzhead-Tale-Janell-Cannon/dp/0152001301">Trupp</a>
is about a large earless cat who hangs out with the homeless) and some
stinkers (Don Freeman’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mop-Top-Don-Freeman/dp/1595190600">Moptop</a> is
about a kid who “needs” a haircut) but the main problem is we don’t
know enough good authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quickly make a random selection from a new part of the picture book
stacks.  More misses than hits but not so bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take most of the books the librarians have pulled out for display on
the tops of the shelves.  This works surprisingly well as the
librarians have better than random taste.  But I feel slightly
guilty—it’s like taking the clothes off the mannequins in a shop
window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these books at home (some several times) there are
always a few keepers that we have to order on Amazon.  Here are the
keepers from our most recent trip:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dahlia-Boston-Globe-Horn-Honors-Awards/dp/0374316783">Dahlia</a>
(by Barbara McClintock): I absolutely love everything about this book–Old
fashioned beautifully detailed line drawings and a story about a
tom-boy who gets a lacy doll as a gift from an aunt.  Great fun and
great message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Night-Paula-Wiseman-Books/dp/1416940057">Cat’s Night Out</a>
(by Caroline Stutson, illustrated by J. Klassen): A counting (by twos) book with tons of cute
dancing cats–the wife and kid love it though I prefer a bit more story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tinka-Rainy-Dohaney/dp/0689852614">Tinka</a> (by
  Rainy Dohaney): This story about a cupcake-sized sheep is only OK
  and the washed out art is nothing special.  But it’s still 4.5/5
  stars because it’s so quirky and R thinks it’s hilarious when the
  crow gets a worm wrapped around his head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Birthday-Presents-Rabbit-Hedgehog/dp/1842700359">The Birthday Presents</a>
(by Paul Stewart and Chris Ridell): Super-cute story about a rabbit and a
hedgehog with classic-looking pictures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There were also a few books that weren’t keepers but merit mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Root-Beer-Banana-Sarah-Sullivan/dp/0763617482">Root Beer and Banana</a>
(by Sarah Sullivan, illustrated by Greg Shed) is about a middle-class country girl and a
poor country girl who become friends over ice pops.  The art is
old-fashioned and I love how the poor girl is treated like a regular
person and not a sad museum exhibit.  But the stereotypes are a little
heavy handed–she’s kind of dirty with ratty clothes, she has no
nearby family, and she only has money she found in the street.  And
she can’t read so good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Priscilla-Pink-Planet-Nathaniel-Hobbie/dp/0316113492">Priscilla and the Pink Planet</a>
  (by Nathaniel Hobbie, illustrated by Jocelyn Hobbie)  has rhymes that are as close to
  Seuss as I’ve every read.  And the art is cute and so is the story.
  I’m not sure why I don’t like this book more.  Maybe it’s because
  the main character reminds me too much of Betty Boop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bracelet-Yoshiko-Uchida/dp/069811390X">The Bracelet</a>
(by Yoshiko Uchida): A picture book about the Japanese-American internment
during WW II.  Definitely not appropriate for a three year old.  A
little too much barbed wire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fly-Free-Roseanne-Thong/dp/1590785509">Fly Free!</a>
(by Roseanne Thong): I want to like this book.  It’s about Buddhist temples
in Vietnam and is all about doing nice things for other people.  The art is pretty.
But I really didn’t like that the temples were caging sparrows so that
people could pay them money to release them (and get good karma).  Can
we just not cage the birds to begin with please?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I went to <a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com/">a local shop</a> and
bought new tires for the mountain bike I ride around town almost every
day.  The angst I felt while deciding exactly what to buy took me by
surprise.  Part of me wanted something cheap and durable that would roll
smoothly and efficiently on pavement. But another part of me wanted to
replace my worn out racing tires with something aggressive, knobby and
impractical for city streets.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenties and thirties the bike I rode defined me more
than my sunglasses, my haircut, or my car. It was more than my
style—it was a major part of my identity. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but imagine what a truck guy’s truck means to him or what an
Apple nerd’s Mac means to him (or her).  A good friend of mine would
call me regularly and say “Got time for some tire talk?”  We would spend
the next half hour dissecting the pros and cons of different treads;
analyzing the tracks we saw out on the trails; debating whether Kevlar
worth the price premium; discussing trends like “thin on the bottom,
knobby on the sides”, and arguing about what tire shed mud or carved
corners best.  At the end though, the most important question was: “What
are you riding right now?”</p>

<p>Since I hit my forties my life has changed a lot.  I spend the vast
majority of my time working, parenting, or doing house stuff.  Trail
riding (and even trail-running) is mostly on hiatus.  My daylight
leisure time is almost always having fun with the girls and when they’re
sleeping at night I’d rather blog than ride.  In a few years (when the girls are
older) I’m sure I’ll be back, but until then, my riding will be limited
to the streets between my offices and classrooms.  This is far far
better than nothing–I actually love battling traffic and the elements.</p>

<p>So it’s been years since my bike’s gotten dirty, but up until last week,
I still had the option of veering onto any trail and cutting through East
Rock Park at a moment’s notice.  And I liked projecting the image of an
MTB guy on his way to a trailhead (even if I was wearing a corduroy
jacket).  Those days are over.  I chose a pair of
<a href="http://www.kendausa.com/en/home/bicycle/commuter.aspx">cheap tires</a>
that ride way better than my old knobbies on the road.  They even
have a little bit of a tread that could handle some of the East Rock
trails.  But now I’m honest with myself and world.  I’m a bike commuter.
It’s not permanent, but it’s true.  And I’m good with that.</p>
