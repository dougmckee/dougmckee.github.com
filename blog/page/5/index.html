  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve always valued a catchy beat over insightful lyrics and my favorite genres tend to reflect that. In other words, I listen to a lot of songs with dumb lyrics, so it means something that the other day I heard some <em>extra</em> dumb lyrics on the radio. </p>

<!--- Bonnie McKee, "American Girl"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-Uh6VZF0R5U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lets take a closer look at Bonnie McKee’s “American Girl” line by line:</p>

<pre><code>I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking slurpees we mixed with alcohol
</code></pre>

<p>Either you’re underage and shouldn’t be mixing in alcohol or you’re of age and shouldn’t be drinking slurpees in the parking lot. I’m not sure which is worse. </p>

<pre><code>We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (whoa oh oh oh)
I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be getting in my way
</code></pre>

<p>This is as good as it gets–girl power!</p>

<pre><code>But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh)
</code></pre>

<p>I think she’s making a subtle sexual reference here. </p>

<pre><code>I just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry
</code></pre>

<p>First off, not one of these four lines actually rhymes, and I don’t think she’s trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant_rhyme">emulate Emily Dickinson</a>. Second, you’re to old to be calling your mother mommy. And third, I think even Gandhi had to occasionally apologize.</p>

<pre><code>Chorus
Oh I'm an American girl
</code></pre>

<p>If the rest of the world thinks this girl is representative of the whole population of American girls, we are in deep trouble.</p>

<pre><code>Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all american girl (Whoa) I was raised by a television
</code></pre>

<p>I spent a good chunk of my childhood in front of a TV too, but I watched relatively wholesome fare like The Brady Bunch, Happy Days, and Gilligan’s Island. She must have been raised by Bridezilla, real Housewives of Beverly Hills and The Jersey Shore. </p>

<pre><code>Every day is a competition Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)
</code></pre>

<p>Oh no; another subtle sexual reference. I think she needs to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_in_Black#Track_listing">AC DC school</a></p>

<pre><code>I wanna see all the stars and everything in between
</code></pre>

<p>Unless she has a thing for dark matter, I have a feeling she’s talking about celebrities more than astronomy.</p>

<pre><code>I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
Cause It's a free country so baby we can do anything (Whoa)
</code></pre>

<p>We may be a free country, but we still have fairly strict laws banning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_trade">sale of organs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Chorus

You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...) Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night) You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...) Oh baby gonna go all night

Chorus
</code></pre>

<p>Every American should be embarrassed that this song exists. I was doubly embarrassed when I saw the “artist” was my namesake. And I’m triply embarrassed by how much I actually enjoy the song. It’s not as good as “Party in the USA” or “Call Me Maybe,” but it just makes me want to get up and dance whenever I hear it.  Maybe I should just stop talking before I embarrass myself further. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to college in the late 1980’s, and <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">my school</a> was just close enough to NYC for the radio stations to play a lot of what was “hot” in the “hot” clubs in the city. And that was a Latin-infused pop dance music called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music">freestyle</a>. It was awesome:</p>

<!--- Noel, "Silent Morning"
--->
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bzA6yO7BO10" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Sweet Sensation, "Hooked on You"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/psQfWUbEDEc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Stevie B, "Spring Love"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sFjoNhUrmU0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I even used my fake ID to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Sensation">Sweet Sensation</a> perform live in Albany. After graduation, I moved to DC where (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHFS_(historic)">Indie Rock was king</a>) and only heard freestyle driving through NYC on my way to and from Boston. The genre died out in NYC just a few years later.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Amazing dance music came into my life again in 2003 when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDLD">103.1 FM</a> in Los Angeles started calling itself KDL and playing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Hits">Dance Hits</a>.”  Instead of building on a Latin groove, they injected what seemed to me to be pure European pop trance directly into unsuspecting American ears.  </p>

<!--- Four Strings, "Take Me Away"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/faHomJimjLc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Junior Senior, "Move Your Feet"
--->
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SPlQpGeTbIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Sophie Ellis Baxtor, "Murder on the Dancefloor"
--->
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BsISfQAXE60" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I was obsessed and then devastated when KDL went off the air after less than a year.  And I wasn’t the only one–there’s a “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCF544CF9FE670FB5">KDL Resurrected</a>” YouTube playlist containing 133 videos that now has 1,607 views!  That number would likely be hundreds bigger if almost all the videos had not been removed due to copyright violations.</p>

<p>And so we come to today. I like Pink, and Maroon 5 and Katy Perry as much as anybody, but I’m ready for some fresh pop blood. In just the last two days I’ve heard these three super catchy and extremely danceable songs on the radio:</p>

<!--- Calvin Harris ft. Ellie Goulding, "I Need Your Love"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AtKZKl7Bgu0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Cobra Starship ft. Sabi, "You Make Me Feel"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HpyZEzrDf4c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Capital Cities, "Safe and Sound"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/47dtFZ8CFo8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lets all cross our fingers that this is just the beginning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-bike-and-shoes.jpg" title="[title &#34;R's bike and my shoes&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;R's bike and my shoes&#34;]" /></p>

<p>Several years ago my wife and I spent a week in Costa Rica during the rainy season. As expected, it rained most of our trip but was warm and fun nonetheless. And those brief windows when the sun came out were magical. I think raising kids is a little like this&ndash;mostly great, but some periods when all the stars align that are truly amazing. </p>

<p>When R was born, my exercise regime changed.  I stopped going to the gym or training for particular events, but I still managed to get out a couple times a week for a run and stay in reasonable shape. When B was born, planned exercise (i.e., beyond chasing kids and racing to work) disappeared as two kids is a bit more work than one and something had to give.</p>

<p>Some people are good at combining exercise with parenting.  They backpack with their kids and push them around with jogging strollers.  My kids don&rsquo;t like activities where they aren&rsquo;t active&ndash;they like pushing strollers more than sitting in them.  Also, sleep is like gold in our house and our kids sleep best in beds. I would never risk waking a sleeping child miles from home because I hit a pot hole.  I&rsquo;ve also seen other parents go bike riding with their kids.  These parents sometimes look like they are having fun, but they certainly aren&rsquo;t getting more exercise than if they were out for a leisurely stroll.</p>

<p>Last week, I entered a fantastic window in my parenting career where I can finally join the ranks of the co-exercising parents.  R is getting pretty comfortable on her bike and I&rsquo;ve been putting on my running shoes to run next to her on her rides. Yesterday she said she loved the feel of the wind in her face as she rode down a long hill. She calls the bike trail near our house &ldquo;the country&rdquo; even though it runs behind the local strip malls on one side, and the highway and an office park on the other.  To her credit, we also saw a ground hog cross the trail and watched ducks congregate in a little pond.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m terribly out of shape and she currently tires easily, but we&rsquo;re both getting better as she learns the fine arts of balance and pacing. It also helps that R and I have had a fair amount of one-on-one time as B&rsquo;s school started full-time last week but R&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be full-time until next week. Unfortunately, I think this window is destined to be brief.  R will eventually want to ride faster and longer than I want to run.  I don&rsquo;t know when that time will come, but it won&rsquo;t surprise me if it&rsquo;s soon given the current trend.  Every day she&rsquo;s substantially more comfortable on the bike and she loves speed.</p>

<p>Going on these bike rides has been incredibly fun and I&rsquo;m just trying to focus on the moment and appreciate them.  I&rsquo;m also already hoping to do it all again in a couple years with B.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a lot of my time creating and editing plain text files. It isn’t the prettiest or most powerful format for documents, but I still love it.  Plain text is trivial to copy and paste between applications, and the files are human readable.  Unlike .doc files, PDF files, or even RTF files, there are a gazillion apps that will show and edit text. And the format has staying power–it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">been around since the 1960’s</a> and I’m willing to bet it will be easy to work with in 20 years and maybe even 50 years. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched a lot of Saturday Night Live in the 1990’s and one of my favorite recurring bits was <a href="http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com">Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey</a>. The soft music would come on, the gentle first sentence or two would scroll by and then BAM–the usually evil but always absurd gotcha at the end. Like a cross between a haiku and a fart.  I didn’t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Handey">Jack Handey</a> was a real person until a few days ago when he released his first novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Stench-Honolulu-Tropical-Adventure/dp/1455522384">The Stench of Honolulu</a>.</p>

<p>The book is about a guy with very few redeeming qualities who travels to Hawaii with his friend Dan in search of the legendary Golden Monkey. To be honest, the story reminds me of the road trips I took with a high school friend when we were in our early 20’s. We toured the American Southwest, Baja California and even the jungles and beaches of Taiwan. And we did bad things in all of these places. I’ve been trying to figure out which of us was Dan and which was the narrator. He was a little meaner (like the narrator) but he also did all the cooking and vehicle maintenance (like Dan). We were both idiots. It’s a tough call. </p>

<p>I listened to a big chunk of the audiobook at the supermarket last  weekend and got plenty of funny looks as I giggled and snorted my way through the aisles. Seriously, this was the funniest stuff I’ve heard in a long time.  But that doesn’t mean you’ll find it funny.  Plenty of Amazon reviewers say it’s just a big pile of potty jokes and they’re kind of right.  I mean, the main character wears his underwear on his head for half the story.  On the other hand it really does read like an amazing 240 page Deep Thought. If you have a low brow sense of humor but can also appreciate Sartres, this book is pure gold.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those readers who didn’t know why it was a big deal,
<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> was two really cool but
distinct things. First, it was a web site where you could specify a
large number of other web sites (aka “feeds”) that publish articles you
might want to read. It would then present those articles all together in
a neat list.  It would keep track of what was new, what you hadn’t read
yet, and what you’d already read. And it was far far more efficient than
going from site to site hitting refresh like a rat pressing a lever for
another hit of crack. This is especially true for people (like me) that
read a lot of sites that don’t publish very often or can go through long
dry spells.</p>

<p>I found the Google Reader web site kind of clunky and ugly, but you didn’t
actually have to ever visit it to experience the benefits. Google Reader
also provided a service so that third party apps could access the same
data and keep your subscriptions in sync if you used apps on different
PC’S or post-PC devices. This is what I used to do, and it was
fantastic. I would use the beautiful/fast/powerful
<a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> app on my phone, Mac, and iPad to browse
my feeds wherever I was. I even used the Google Reader website
occasionally.</p>

<p>And then Google announced they were shutting it all down on July 1.
Panic ensued, but the nerderati told us to be patient–they promised
even better alternatives would quickly blossom to take its place.  It
took a few months, but they were right. Unfortunately, I’ve had a busy
spring and summer and haven’t had the time to try them all to find the
best one.  Luckily, lots of other folks have invested their time
and I think there’s a decent consensus for a winner.</p>

features Google Reader did.  It costs $19.99 per year, but that’s a
small price to pay for stability.  With paying customers, they won’t
have nearly the temptation to just turn it off if they don’t feel like
running it anymore.  They won’t be shoving ads down our throat either
which I always felt was just around the corner with Google Reader.</p>

<p>Feed Wrangler has a web site for reading and also provides free client
apps for the iPhone and iPad.  The iPhone client has some serious
flaws. It’s definitely slower to sync new stuff than Reeder was. It
doesn’t support gestures to mark things read or unread.  And worst of
all, the default (unchangeable) font size is too small for me to read
unless I’m wearing my reading glasses. Thank goodness my old standby
Reeder will be supporting Feed Wrangler soon.  I don’t read much on my
iPad, but Mr. Reader already supports the Feed Wrangler service.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part about Feed Wrangler is the two things it does that
Google Reader never did.  Smart Streams let you define “collections” of
articles based on keywords and sources.  It’s much more powerful than a
folder and will let me sip from the high volume feeds that I would normally
stay away from. Filters are the opposite–you can define key words that
will cause an article to be automatically considered read and thus
ignored.  This way I can subscribe to the ESPN feed and never have to
read another story about hockey or NASCAR.  Bill Simmons’ <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmonsnfl2010/101105">ESPN
Outsider</a>
has arrived!</p>

<p>Google Reader is dead, but it was stagnant for years.  I’m legitimately excited about
a new era of innovation. Feed Wrangler has just won round one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I loved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books">Wizard of Oz</a> when I was a kid. Not the movie and not just the book, but the whole series of books and the whole world of Oz and the whole host of amazing characters. L. Frank Baum wrote 14 books and by the end of second grade I had read them all. The Scarecrow, the Patchwork Girl, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gump#The_Gump">the Gump</a>, the Cowardly Lion, and the Hungry Tiger (just to name a few) were some of my best friends. Given that my daughter R has a wild imagination and a voracious appetite for books, you can’t blame me for introducing  these stories as soon as possible. Actually, it was too soon.</p>

<p>We started reading a seriously condensed picture book version when she was about two years old. She thought it was terrific and for months all she wanted to do was to act out the story. She was Dorothy for Halloween last year, and right around R’s 4th birthday, we read a chapter of the unabridged <em>Wizard of Oz</em> every night. She loved it and even though it revved her up a little right before she was supposed to go to sleep, we finished it and dove right into the <em>Land of Oz</em>. Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse were as fun as the original characters and we zipped through <em>Ozma of Oz</em> where we got to meet our first Oz princess.</p>

<p>We hit a wall with <em>Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz</em>. The invisible bears were just too scary. That night it took a little longer than usual to get to sleep and the next night, R wanted to read something else. </p>

<p>Last weekend we had a similar experience.  As soon as it got warm enough, R has been zooming around on her pink Dora bike with training wheels. We would go as fast as we caould around the block and I would run down the hills to keep up with her. She was looking a little cramped and since the seat wouldn’t go up any higher, I thought it was time for a new bike. Our awesome local shop (<a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com">The Devil’s Gear</a>) had a used 16” bike that was perfect and we picked it up. It didn’t have training wheels and R said that was fine with her.</p>

<p>I also thought since B just turned two, she was ready for her first bike. We decided to pick up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MyKick-Balance-Bike-Cotton-Candy/dp/B009T2SITU">Burley MyKick</a>. It’s got two wheels and no pedals so you learn to balance right away. My friend Google tells me it’s easier to transition to a “real bike” from one of these than from a bike with training wheels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we did not have the fun-filled weekend of bike-riding that I was hoping for.  As soon as we got home, we learned  that both kids were too little for their new bikes. Seats only go so low. The only short term benefit was that R enjoyed racing the MyKick up and down the driveway.</p>

<p>This weekend things got a lot better. R decided she was ready to ride her new bike and this evening we did 4 laps around the block!  It didn’t take long for her to master the straight-aways up hill and down hill. But the seat is still too high and she needs support to start or stop. She’s going to be a menace to herself and our neighbors for a while yet.</p>

<p>Books and bikes are pretty low stakes things, and I don’t feel so bad starting them on the early side. We’ll return to Oz at some point. Our new bikes will be be there when the girls are totally ready. But some decisions are a lot harder to recover from if you make a mistake. Parents of kids who were born late in the year know where I’m going with this: When is the right time to start school?</p>

<p>I’m a December birthday and I started first grade when I was 5. My mom had to convince the principal to bend the rules since technically I was supposed to be 6 by September 1. Throughout elementary, middle school, and high school I was the youngest kid in the class. I was pretty emotionally immature. I had regular “accidents” until third grade. I always had trouble with girls and I think at least part of that was being younger than they were. And yet I feel strongly that it was the right decision for me. I was curious and intellectually ambitious and competitive. I would have been bored silly if I had been held back and even as it was, I wish I’d been challenged more. </p>

<p>I’ve also met lots of people with late in the year birthdays that were pushed into school early, and they’re bitter about it to this day. They really believe they would have had a more comfortable and successful school experience had their parents waited. And maybe their parents should have waited.</p>

<p>The trendy thing to do now is to wait. I swear it all started when Malcolm Gladwell’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922">Outliers</a> came out in 2008.  In the first chapter, he tells a story about how elite Canadian hockey players were all born in January or February. When these guys started playing, they were the biggest, most skilled kids on their age-graded teams and so were plucked out and given additional training/coaching. Maybe being the oldest kid in kindergarten or first grade helps with academics too. Maybe.</p>

<p>I strongly believe the “right” answer about when to start school depends on the kid (and the school). R was born in late November and will be starting kindergarten next year (before she turns 5). We will be watching her closely. The academic part of school will be no problem. She’s already got great reading and math skills and she loves to learn. On the social/emotional side, she acts her age. That might be hard when most of her friends are older. We are definitely open to having her repeat kindergarten at a new school. We’re also open to her moving on to first grade. We’re not open to doing something just because everyone else is doing it. We’ll make the decision based on her.</p>
