  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m old. I grew up wandering around record stores trying to decide
whether to buy albums based on one or two songs I might have heard on
the radio, cover art, and what I knew about the band. These were big
decisions when I didn’t have much money and cd’s were $15-17 each.</p>

<p>Today’s online music world couldn’t be more different.  Kids these days
think about albums like they’re rotary dial phones–they download gobs of
music for free (e.g., BitTorrent) or they just listen to whatever they
want through Pandora or Spotify.  And when they do actually shell out cash,
it’s 99 cents per song.</p>

<p>But I live in the past and still agonize over album purchases.  Prices have
gone down and my income has gone up a little, but I like owning my
music legally and I still like listening to the set of songs an artist
chose to package together as an album.  Over time though, I’ve developed
a few rules to guide me in the decision process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Learn from previous purchases if the band produces albums with a few
good tracks and filler.  Madonna and Metallica both produce tremendous
quality throughout while Katy Perry is more up and down.  The younger
the artist, the more careful you have to be (Yes I’m looking at you
Justin Bieber!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Best of” albums can be a treasure trove (e.g., Electric Light
Orchestra or Heart) if original album quality is spotty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beware of bargains–it’s those dreaded filler albums that are
most often on sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can restrain yourself from the impulse purchase, listen to the
album a couple times through on Spotify first.  A minute and a half
sample often isn’t enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iTunes has deluxe versions of many albums that contain remixes and
the occasional music video.  With YouTube, the video’s not much of a
draw, but I never regret the remixes which are often better than the
original versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because it’s a concept album doesn’t you shouldn’t. cherry pick
the best tracks. Judas Priest’s <em>Nostradamus</em> just isn’t that good even
though the second track (“Prophecy”) rocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As bends enter the twilight of their careers, albums get worse and
worse even though they can still produce individually good
songs. Metallica and Depeche Mode are great examples. This is the bright
side of a great band breaking up mid-career like The Beatles, Led
Zeppelin, or The Smiths.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Bottom line: The album may be dying, but it’s not dead yet.  At least
not in my little fantasy world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Messenger bags have been getting a lot of flack on
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/backpacks-my-bff/">Ben Brooks’ blog</a>
lately as he has made the complete switch to a
<a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0103">Tom Bihn Smart Alec backpack</a>.
He raves about the ergonomics and pockets and even makes a case that it
looks kinda cool.  Maybe this set up works for him, but I’m very happy
with my decidedly non-hipster plain vanilla blue and black
<a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/classic-messenger/1809057">Timbuk2 Classic Messenger</a>.</p>

<p>It’s almost all one cavernous compartment which gives me maximum
flexibility.  It’s is perfect for any combination of books, folders,
iPads, or my MacBook Air in it’s Zero Shock sleeve.  I leave the sleeve
unzipped so it’s easy to take the MBA in and out and if I don’t need it,
the whole sleeve/MBA combo stays home.  I love the simplicity of never
having to remember what’s in what pocket.  I’ve even used it to
transport pretty big boxes– they can stick out if need be and the flap
can partially cover them but be secured by the strap.</p>

<p>It’s super-fast to open and close since I don’t have to take it off my
back or loosen any straps.  I can keep my bike lock there when I’m out
and about and it’s trivial to pull it out and put it back in as needed.</p>

<p>It’s perfect for cycling–the weight is on your hips instead of your
back/shoulders and that makes for much better stability.  Just make sure
you use the strap that attaches to a belt loop so it doesn’t swing
around unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The ballistic nylon show almost no wear.  My bag is six years old and
I’ve put it through the laundry maybe three times.  And it’s not like I’ve
babied it–it’s with me outdoors every day rain, shine, or even the
arctic conditions of last winter in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The bottom line: Six years from now I’ll probably be using exactly the
same bag.  And it’ll still look great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have noticed that I hardly ever write posts that just link to
something good I’ve read elsewhere on the web.  That’s what most people
use Tumblr for, but my main goal here is to write and share original
content.  It doesn’t mean I don’t run across things I find interesting
and want to share through other channels.  I also like to save good
stuff in the cloud where I can easily access and search it.  I hate
remembering I saw something and then not being able to find it again
later.  These two related goals (sharing and archival) have led me to a
somewhat unique system that I think satisfies both pretty well.</p>

<p>I do most of my reading of web content in a browser, an RSS reader
(Reeder), or Instapaper, and want to be able to share and archive easily
in all three.  If all I wanted to do was share, I’d probably hold my
nose and just tweet everything.  Twitter is well-integrated into all
three apps and my friends could just follow me or visit the Twitter
website as needed.  But I want to be able to archive <strong>and</strong> share in a
single step.</p>

<p><a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> is an <em>almost</em> free service that stores bookmarks and lets you
search them by tags you assign.  I pay a little extra ($25/yr) and they
save the full text of the pages and let me search that too.  They
provide a bookmarklet that lets me tag pages from almost any web browser
and the same functionality is built into my RSS reader.  If I think my
friends might also find a page interesting, I just add a “like” tag.</p>

<p><a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> is a service that saves content that
I find on the web but don’t have time to read in the moment.  When it’s
more convenient, I bring up the Instapaper app on my iPhone or iPad and
it’s turned all my saved pages into beautifully formatted highly
readable ad-free text.  If I like what I read there, I just mark it that
way by clicking on the heart icon.  I have my account configured to then
automatically send the link to Pinboard for archival.</p>

<p>There are several ways for you to see what I’ve found interesting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Follow me on pinboard; my username is dmckee.  You’ll see everything I
tag, including stuff I’m archiving but not necessarily recommending.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visit my pinboard pages:</p>

    <p>What I like: <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/t:like">https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/t:like</a></p>

    <p>What got sent over from Instapaper: <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/from:instapaper">https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/from:instapaper</a></p>

    <p>I wish these could be combined in a single page.  If Instapaper would
  tag items I like with “like” when it sends them to Pinboard, you would
  only have to visit the first one.  My system is good, but it’s not perfect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subscribe to my Pinboard RSS feeds:</p>

    <p><a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/t:like">http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/t:like</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/from:instapaper">http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/from:instapaper</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow me on Instapaper (dmckee@ucla.edu).  You only get a subset of
the stuff I’m sharing, but it’s a good subset.  I wish things I share
directly through Pinboard would automatically get liked and archived in
Instapaper so this would be complete.  But not even
<a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt.com</a> can take care of this.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A few of the blogs I read publish an about-weekly list of their very
favorite recent links.  Maybe I’ll do that someday, but for now we’re
going with this.</p>

  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down again.
  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down.
 
           "All Men Play on 10" 
           <em>Manowar, Sign of the Hammer</em>, 1984
</pre>

<p>Songs that celebrate rock and roll are a dime a dozen.  I mean, I love
Joan Jett’s “I Love Rock and Roll” and Ozzy Osbourne’s “You Can’t Kill
Rock and Roll” and even Huey Lewis’ “Heart of Rock and
Roll” as much as anyone, but the idea is a little played out.</p>

<p>On the other hand, songs that literally <strong>demand</strong> to be played loud and
explicitly proclaim the band’s love of loud music are tremendously
under-appreciated.  It’s a much smaller genre, but I can (and do) listen
to these songs over and over.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of my favorites (<a href="http://c.itunes.apple.com/us/imix/play-it-loud!/id497298702">Ping version</a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>“All Men Play on 10” <em>Manowar</em></li>
  <li>“Turn Up the Radio” <em>Autograph</em></li>
  <li>“I Love It Loud” <em>Kiss</em></li>
  <li>“Shout It Out Loud” <em>Kiss</em></li>
  <li>“Louder than Hell” <em>Motley Crue</em></li>
  <li>“We Like It Loud” <em>Rough Cutt</em></li>
  <li>“Turn It Up” <em>Ted Nugent</em></li>
  <li>“The Right to Rock” <em>Keel</em></li>
  <li>“I Wanna Rock” <em>Twisted Sister</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The first track, “All Men Play on 10” by Manowar is not the most
popular, but definitely has the most testosterone.  Everyone has
probably heard “Turn Up the Radio” by Autograph as it got tons of
airplay during the eighties, but Kiss has to be the undisputed king of
the category with two contributions: “I Love It Loud” and “Shout it Out
Loud”.  “Louder than Hell” from Motley Crue wasn’t one of their hits,
but it’s always been one of my favorites.  Rough Cutt’s “We Like it
Loud” and Ted Nugent’s “Turn It Up” are more obscure, but still
classics.</p>

<p>The last two songs on my list are honorable mentions because they’re
really more straight up rock anthems than only tangentially suggest that
music shouldn’t be turned down.  Keel’s “The Right to Rock” says</p>

<pre>
  Don't let anyone tell you
  How to live your life
  We won't turn it off
  We won't turn it down
  'Cause it's our way of life
</pre>

<p>while Twisted Sister’s “I Wanna Rock” says:</p>

<pre>
  Turn it down you say,
  Well all i got to say to you is 
  Time and time again i say, "no!"
  No! no, no, no, no, no!
</pre>

<p>I’m absolutely certain I’ve left out some important tracks.  So any
suggested additions will be much appreciated!</p>

<h2 id="update">Update:</h2>

<p>I asked for help on
<a href="http://www.classicrockforums.com/forum/f7/play-loud-19367/">Classic Rock Forums</a> and got some
great suggested additions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Loud” <em>Sammy Hagar</em></li>
  <li>“Shout” <em>Grand Prix</em></li>
  <li>“Blow Your Speakers” <em>Manowar</em></li>
  <li>“Loud and Clear” <em>Autograph</em></li>
  <li>“Play It Loud” <em>Diamond Head</em></li>
  <li>“Play It Loud” <em>Saxon</em></li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t believe I forgot to include “Blow Your Speakers”, but the other five tracks
are new to me.  Every one is worth a listen–cranked up all the way of
course!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend Julian is a pretty nice guy.  He’s generous with his time and
tolerant of most social behavior.  He honors his commitments and is
honest in his communication.  But at the same time, he chooses not to
participate in the US democratic government by voting.  For those of us
who see voting as a moral obligation, this is somewhat disturbing.
Julian recently posted a
<a href="http://tunesforbears.com/2012/01/19/no-really-i-dont-vote/">clear statement of why</a>
on <a href="http://tunesforbears.com">his blog</a> (which makes for a good read in general
BTW).  Since he is economic theorist by training, he makes his argument
by laying out a fairly standard economic model of voting and pointing
out how it is perfectly rational for him to vote and many other people
not to.</p>

<p>In Julian’s model, people benefit from voting in two ways: the (slight)
chance they will personally influence the election and the “warm glow”
(WG) they get from the experience.  If the sum of these outweigh the
costs of missing work and traveling to the polling place, then people
will vote.  Julian justifies his personal decision by saying that most
other people must get a warmer feeling inside when they vote since the
chance of any one person changing the election is tiny.  As
models go, this one is pretty empty (as Julian admits) since so much of
the action happens in WG and it says nothing about where WG comes from.</p>

<p>I think utilitarian models are great for describing behavior, but lousy
for defining what behavior is right or wrong.  Just because someone
might find stealing to be individually rational if their chances of
being caught are low, that doesn’t make it right.  Before I go on, I
want to be perfectly clear that I don’t know anything about
philosophy–I couldn’t even make much sense of this
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Beginners-Writers-Readers-Documentary/dp/086316157X">comic book guide to philosphy</a>
when I read it a few years ago.  That said, Julian’s description of
Kant’s categorical imperative really spoke to me.  In his (Julian’s)
words, “citizens are morally obligated to vote if they prefer a world in
which others do”.  I translate this to mean “it’s immoral to free-ride
on other people’s voting behavior”.  This is a statement <em>outside</em> the
model about behavior that may or may not be rational <em>inside</em> the model.
Julian justifies his own action in this context by saying he wants
everyone to act as he would act <em>conditional on the WG they happen to
feel</em>.</p>

<p>If Kant were here, I think he would say that WG is BS and that people
don’t decide whether or not to vote in order to maximize their
utility–they decide between right and wrong.  I vote because I want
to live in a world where everyone (or at least the informed folks vote),
not because it makes me feel warmer than it does Julian.  To be more
precise, I think WG is almost homogeneously distributed and some people
are moral and some are immoral free-riders.</p>

<p>Of course, my statement about Julian being an upstanding moral guy in
the rest of his life still holds.  :) I just think he’s putting too much
faith in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics">the first theorem of welfare economics</a>.
Just because there are some (many?) situations where individually
rational behavior leads to a socially optimal outcome doesn’t mean all
situations are like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jacob Mincer’s 1958 paper in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>,
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1827422">“Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution”</a>,
is one of the most well-cited in economics–304 times according to
<a href="http://apps.isiknowledge.com">Web of Science</a>.  And yet, I would be
shocked if more than half the people who’ve cited the paper have even
opened it and read the first page.  The reason it’s cited so often is that Mincer
did indeed write down the famed Mincer equation here, but he
wasn’t the first to notice that log wages are an approximately linear
function of years of education.  What’s special about this paper is that
Mincer was the first person to write down a simple utility-maximizing
model from which you can derive such an equation.</p>

<p>Wages are not normally distributed.  The lower half of the distribution
is all clustered together, but the high end is really spread out.  And
all those
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street">one percenters</a> at the
high end are making far more than average wages.  But physical
dimensions like height, head circumference, and forearm length <em>are</em>
normally distributed.  And though it’s a lot harder to measure, most
scholars believe that cognitive ability is normally distributed too. In
the early part of the twentieth century, this was seen as something of a
paradox–if physical and cognitive ability are the major determinants of
productivity then shouldn’t wages (which measure productivity) also be
normally distributed? </p>

<p>The average gain in wages that comes from an additional year of schooling
increases with the amount of schooling someone has.  Expected wages go
up by more for the 16th year of schooling than the 12th year of
schooling.  One of Mincer’s insights was that a big part of the
non-normality of the wage distribution is a direct consequence of these
non-linear returns to schooling.</p>

<p>Mincer had great intuition.  He recognized that a person must eventually
be compensated for wages they could have earned during the years they
attend school.  The more schooling you already have, the more you need
to be compensated for getting an additional year of schooling.  Mincer
shows that in his model, wages must increase multiplicatively for each
year and that is exactly what happens when the log wage is a linear
function of years of education.  In the data, wages are generally
associated with about a 15 <em>percent</em> increase for each year of
schooling.</p>

<p>Academic economists worship at the altar of the new and technically
sophisticated.  This means the vast majority of econ papers written
before the 1980’s just languish on library shelves.  And even though
it’s true that most of these older papers aren’t terribly relevant, I
think Mincer (1958) is just one of several diamonds in the rough.  I’m
always on the look out for more, and would welcome any suggestions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I’m not the first to notice that these two musical acts have a
few things in common, but I bet the similarities go deeper than
you think.</p>

<h2 id="the-obvious">The Obvious</h2>

<p>Both groups were young, attractive, and British.  In the beginning, they
played catchy simple pop songs and were incredibly successful.  Both
also made fun movies about the band running around getting in trouble
and playing music (“A Hard Day’s Night” and “Spice World”).</p>

<h2 id="the-members">The Members</h2>

<p>The Beatles and the Spice Girls both had nicknames and you can even kind
of match them up together.  Paul was the Cute baby-faced one–kind of
like Baby Spice.  George was the Quiet one–kind of like Posh Spice.  It
starts to break down with Ringo (the Funny one), but we’ll give that to
Sporty.  And then there’s John (the Smart one) with no obvious
counterpart.  Ginger Spice left the band (was kicked out??) early on,
just like Pete Best, and both events inspired the anger of many loyal
fans.  I remember reading about “Pete is Best” signs and chants when I
was a kid.  But then It turned out that Pete and Ginger <em>were</em> each the
least talented of the bunch–I’ve tried several times to like Ginger’s
(Geri Halliwell’s) solo efforts, but they sound awful even to me.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-fact">After the fact</h2>

<p>Looking back, both groups had short but intense careers–the Beatles
showed up in the early 1960’s and were gone by 1970 and The Spice Girls
released all three of their albums between 1996 and 2000.  But after
their breakups, every single member went on to release solo albums.
Paul McCartney and Emma (Baby Spice) Bunton both produced great work,
while John’s brilliant solo career was cut short by tragedy.  Victoria
Beckham (Posh) also started a promising solo career with her terrific
self-titled album (featuring “Not Such an Innocent Girl”), but bowed out
of the music business too soon to concentrate on her family with David
Beckham.  And though most of the solo albums had their bright spots, the
whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts for both bands.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest similarity is that even many years after their
primes, both bands are still widely considered the best ever of their
respective genres.  Sure, manufactured-girl-band-pop is less
important than rock and roll, but even so, the Spice Girls
deserve some respect!  Girl Power!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google’s greatest power is ubiquity.  Almost everyone uses
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for search.
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google</a> has become the standard place
people store their RSS subscription information.  And
<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> seems like it’s almost
there too.  That means if you run a small group that has events, you
should strongly consider putting together a Google Calendar for it that
members can subscribe to.  That way the group events can plop right down
into the calendar that many members already refer to every day.  Classes
and weekly seminars are a perfect match.</p>

<p>It’s surprisingly easy and I’m doing it with both my classes this
semester.  Here’s what my TA and I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new calendar making sure to check the “Make This Calendar
Public” box.</li>
  <li>Add all the lectures (with weekly topics), exams, and paper due dates as
separate events.</li>
  <li>Go to Calendar Settings for the calendar and click on ICAL next to
Calendar Address to get a link for it.</li>
  <li>Email the group and tell them all to bring up Google Calendar, scroll
down to Other Calendars, and click on the little triangle next to it.
Then they should select Add By URL and paste in the link that popped up
at the end of Step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re deep into our first winter in the new house and are just now
figuring out how to properly control the indoor temperature.  On the
plus side, we’ve got the ingredients of a fabulous heating system.  The
brand-new
<a href="http://www.buderus.us/products/gasheating/gasconventionalboilers/loganog234x.html">gas-fired boiler</a>
is <em>so</em> much cheaper and cleaner than the oil-fueled relic that was here
when we moved in.  The house was built in the 1920’s and has one
or two huge radiators in every room.  We even have a
programmable thermostat (a Lux TX500B which is nearly identical to the
current <a href="http://www.luxproducts.com/thermostats/tx500e.php">Lux TX500E</a>)
so we can lower the temperature during the day when we’re at work and at
night when we’re in bed.</p>

<p>For the last couple months, the thermostat would turn on the boiler at
6:00 am and keep it on until the house reached 68 F.  The problem was
that even though the boiler turned off, the radiators were still full of
hot water and they would continue heating the house driving the
temperature up to 71 or 72 and driving me kind of crazy.  The same thing
would happen in the afternoon when we got home from work.</p>

<p>My first thought was that there must be a setting on the thermostat to
account for what I’m calling “radiator heat momentum”.  There isn’t.
The closest you can get is to lower the minimum amount of time the
boiler is on and that doesn’t actually help in most situations.  My
second thought was that this was a great excuse to get a
<a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest</a>–it’s the only thermostat anyone has ever
described as sexy, but as far as I can tell, its AI smarts are all about
saving you 10 minutes of programming.  This is especially true if you
have a pretty rigid schedule.  And it has no special knowledge of
radiators.  Oh well.</p>

<p>The solution we’ve settled on is imperfect, but  good and easy to
implement with some semi-creative thermostat programming.</p>

<p>WEEKDAYS: In the morning, we simply set the thermostat to go to 66 and
the temperature drifts up to where we want it after the boiler turns
off.  During the day, the house goes down to 62 and at 4:30 pm, the
thermostat goes back to 67.  The temperature drifts up a little higher
than we’d like, but we don’t want it to drop below 67 before we go to
bed and we can only have 4 different temperature settings per day. (Yes,
I think this restriction is ridiculous.)</p>

<p>WEEKENDS: At 6:00 am, the thermostat jumps to 66 and drifts up to about
68 within the hour.  At 7:00 am, the thermostat goes to 68 and that
keeps the house from getting too cold during the day when we are around.  We also set the
Swing on the thermostat to 0.25 degrees; this means the boiler turns on
fairly often for short periods of time but these little firings during the
day don’t generate much momentum–it’s really just the big push in the
morning and in the afternoon during the week that cause a problem.  It’s
possible we could raise the Swing and be a little more efficient and
still not generate much heat momentum.</p>

<p>I’m don’t know why other folks aren’t complaining about this (since
radiator heat isn’t <em>that</em> rare) and why the thermostats don’t handle it
more transparently.  My best guess is that less than mammoth radiators
don’t hold their heat as well and so it’s just not an issue in houses
with average radiators.  Either that or the solution I’ve come up with
is so obvious that no one feels the need to talk about it.  My ego tells
me it’s the former so I’m going with that.</p>

<p>These three videos are objectively hilarious.  I was going to write a
pithy insightful post about the humor found in the juxtaposition of the
contemporary and the mundane with one of the most evil and destructive
dictators of all time. It turns out I’m a little late to the
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/">Downfall</a> parody party.  If you are too, I highly recommend reading
this 2010 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8617454.stm">BBC article</a> and of course browsing Youtube for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=downfall+parody">hundreds more</a>.</p>
