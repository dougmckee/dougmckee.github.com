<p>Conan the Snowman, was a fierce barbaric soul,<br />
With a sword of steel and a battle cry, total victory was his goal.  </p>

<p>Conan the Snowman, is a fantasy, they say.<br />
He was from far North, but the children know, he raided their village one day.  </p>

<p>There must have been some anger in that well-worn blade he held,<br />
For when he swung it round his head, his enemies they were felled.    </p>

<p>Oh, Conan, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;<br />
and the children say he could laugh and slay,<br />
any man and his family.  </p>

<p>Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,<br />
look at their heads roll. </p>

<p>Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,<br />
vanquishing his foe.  </p>

<p>Conan the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,<br />
so he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fight, all day and all night, until rain washes the blood away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raging through the village, with his deadly sword in hand,<br />
Running here and there, all around the square,
sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Kill me if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he wandered east to a fearsome beast and met it eye to eye.<br />
and only paused a moment, when we heard him scream out, &ldquo;Die!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>For Conan, the Snowman, made all his enemies pay,<br />
But he waved goodbye, sayin&rsquo; &ldquo;You better cry,<br />
I&rsquo;ll be back again some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/hv-sequence-for-kids.jpg" /></p>

<p>With the holidays upon us it seems like every geek blogger I read has been recommending family-friendly board games. <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013boardgames">MacSparky</a> sent me to <a href="http://fannypackmafia.com/blog/2013/12/8/my-favorite-board-games-from-2013-part-one">Fanny Pack Mafia</a>, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/12/gift-guide-actually-used-for-a-year">Marco</a> says <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YDBLE/?tag=marcoorg-20">Power Grid</a> is really good, and <a href="http://kottke.org/13/11/how-to-quickly-get-good-at-chess">Kottke</a> is sending me to <a href="http://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/">Gautam Narula</a> to improve my chess game. This is all well and good, but these games are a bit much for my 2.5 and 5 year old kids.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why our favorite game hasn&rsquo;t been on any of these lists.</p>

<p>The rules for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UM9P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00005UM9P&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=highvari-20">Sequence for Kids</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=highvari-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00005UM9P" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
are simple. The game starts with each player getting three cards and a pile of their own colored chips. The cards have animals on them as does the board which is a 6x7 square grid. A turn consists of playing a card and putting one of your chips on a square that has the same animal that was on the card. Players replenish their hand by picking another card from the deck at the end of their turn. The goal is to get four chips in a row. There are two &ldquo;magical&rdquo; animals: The Unicorn card lets a player put their chip on any square while the Dragon card lets a player remove any chip from the board.</p>

<p>Many games for little kids are designed simply to teach rule following and maybe some hand-eye coordination as the player spins a spinner or picks a card and moves their token along a track. Chutes and Ladders and Candyland are the canonical examples of a genre that rots adult brains. Sequence includes enough strategy that kids are challenged, and enough randomness that they have a chance to win against adults.</p>

<p>The set of skills kids can learn (or practice) while playing is surprisingly rich:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> Players need to make sequences of two before they can make three and then four to win. They need to recognize when their opponent is about to win, and then block them if possible. </li>
  <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Players should save their special cards for when they need them for defense or offense.</li>
  <li><strong>Reasoning about uncertainty:</strong> I wonder if my opponent has a Lion in their hand and could win next turn?  I wonder if I could pick a Lion from the deck for my next turn? Maybe two Lions have already been played and none are left!</li>
  <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Where are my winning opportunities? Four in a row wins whether it is across, down or diagonal.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> R thinks the magic animals are the best part of the game and we often make up our own rules to create more. Sometimes the Kangaroo card lets you put down a chip on a Kangaroo and another square next to it. Sometimes the Shark can eat another animal and let you put your own chip in its place. The possibilities are endless.</li>
  <li><strong>Reading:</strong> The game even promotes reading in a subtle way. The cards have pictures of the animals for non-readers, words for the animal  (e.g. &ldquo;Penguin&rdquo;) for learning readers, and even a fun name for the animal (e.g., &ldquo;Percy&rdquo;) for actual readers. </li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps the best part of the game is that it&rsquo;s easy to modify the game for players of any age. We often play with cards face up.  This makes reasoning about your opponent&rsquo;s next move a little clearer and has two other big advantages: Little uncoordinated hands don&rsquo;t have to try to hold three cards at once, and it&rsquo;s a lot easier to teach strategy when you can see what cards your kid is holding.  I&rsquo;ve also played a fairly rule-free version of the game with one and two year-olds where we just deal out cards and place chips on the board. These kids love the animals and the bright colors of the chips and even like matching the animals to the squares on the board. </p>

<p>Sequence for Kids really is fun for the whole family!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the best things about having a second child is getting to do all your favorite little kid things again.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Near the top of that list for me is re-reading our best picture books, and L, at 2.5 years old is just now appreciating the stories as well as the pictures. These five books have been particularly popular over the last few weeks:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-uncle-elephant.jpg" title="[title &#34;Uncle Elephant&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;Uncle Elephant&#34;]" /></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Elephant-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064441040">Uncle Elephant</a> (written and illustrated by Arnold Lobel) Like all of Arnold Lobel’s books, the illustrations are classic, the stories are clever, and the messages are deep. A boy loses his parents at the beginning and he bonds with his Uncle who takes care of him until his parents come back. Among other things, they walk in the garden, sing songs, and grant wishes to spiders. Uncle Elephant is the grandfather everyone wanted when they were growing up. We’ve also been enjoying Lobel’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=lobel%20frog%20and%20toad">Frog and Toad stories</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">Pup and Hound Catch a Thief</a> (written by Susan Hood, illustrated by Linda Hendry) This criminally under-rated series of books is published by Kids Can Press where it gets lost in a slew of mediocre tales of poorly behaved cats (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mittens-My-First-Can-Read-ebook/dp/B006JQTQNG">Mittens</a>) and dogs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pizza-Sam-Kids-Can-Read/dp/1553373316">Sam</a>). The rhymes and artwork are cute, and the stories have twists at the end that both L and I can appreciate.</p>

I just realized there’s a well-reviewed sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/There-Are-Cats-this-Book/dp/0763649546">There are no cats in this book</a>) and can’t wait to check that out too!</li>

<time datetime="2013-12-13T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 13<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Note: You might want to read my other <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/categories/photo/">posts about photo management</a> for context first.)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-dropbox.jpg" /></p>

<p>I am extremely happy to report some actual forward progress in this episode of My Photo Management Quest.  The short story is that all my photos now live on Dropbox in a nice hieararchical folder structure where I can browse and share them from any of my computers or iOS devices. My new system isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty good and I think it’s a solid foundation for the future.</p>

<h2 id="moving-from-iphoto-to-dropbox">Moving from iPhoto to Dropbox</h2>

<p>iPhoto is fundamentally an application for doing light editing and organization of photos on a single computer. Any new system that involves access from multiple different devices is going to require getting your photos out of iPhoto’s black box. My first step was to do <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/moving-from-iphoto-to-dropbox/">what Federico Vittici at MacStories did</a> through a combination of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phoshare/">PhoShare</a> and <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a>.  The process created a set of year folders, and in each of those, a set of month folders that contain all my photos named and sorted by date. I also followed his lead and created a Hazel rule to move files from the Camera Uploads folder (where Dropbox puts my just-taken photos and videos) into my new Photos hierarchy. That means I need do absolutely nothing after I click my iPhone’s shutter button for my photos to be organized and accessible (by me) forever in the cloud. What a breath of fresh air compared to Apple’s Photo Stream!</p>

<p>My photos currently take up about 20GB, and Dropbox charges $99 per 100GB. Give how rock solid Dropbox is and how many iOS apps support it, I think that’s a great deal. </p>

<h2 id="further-organization-and-editing-on-the-mac">Further Organization and Editing on the Mac</h2>

<p>I’ve been manually adding a bit more organization in two ways. First, I’ve split some months into separate events. For example, I created a “2013-10-halloween” folder (inside the “2013” folder) that contains the requisite costume and pumpkin photos. These photos no longer live in the generic “2013-10” folder. I’ve also created a few special folders (e.g., “yummy-things”) outside the date-based hierarchy that have <em>copies</em> of some pictures in the date-based hierarchy.  That way I can find those pictures by date or subject. I can also easily share these folders (read-only) with friends and family using Dropbox shared links. </p>

<p>The best way I’ve found so far to actually create these new folders is Coverflow view in Finder. It’s <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/23562534#23562534">buggy in Mavericks</a> and it doesn’t let me see enough at the same time, but it works. I’m sure there are better ways (maybe <a href="http://unboundformac.com">Unbound for Mac</a> when it’s more stable, maybe <a href="http://www.arcsoft.com/photoplus/">Photo+ by Arcsoft</a>, maybe <a href="http://www.lynapp.com">Lyn</a>) but I haven’t settled on one yet.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of having my photos live in the file system is that I’m not locked into iPhoto for editing–I can now use whatever app I want. <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com">Pixelmator</a> is nice and I’m sure I’ll eventually settle on an even lighter weight app for easy stuff (e.g., cropping/red-eye reduction/brightness adjustment).</p>

<h2 id="browsing-on-ios">Browsing on iOS</h2>

<p>Now that my photos live in Dropbox, I have at least three choices of iOS apps to browse them.  The <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp">Dropbox app</a>’s photo tab lets me scroll through thumbnails of all my photos sorted by date and download full resolution versions as needed. I can also browse the folder structure through the standard file browing UI and grab photos, though I don’t get a pretty set of big thumbnails.  Playing videos and sharing links to files and folders is easy.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-heliog.png" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.heliogapp.com">Heliog</a> is fast and pretty–it preserves my folder hierarchy and shows nice screens of thumbnails. I can share folders or sets of photos and easily move photos between folders. The downsides are that it doesn’t play video and I can’t delete photos from the photo view (have to be in the album view). These both seem easily fixable.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-unbound.jpg" /></p>

<p>Right now, I think <a href="http://unboundapp.com">Unbound</a> is the best of the bunch.  Unlike Heliog, it plays videos and let’s me delete photos from the photo view. Like Heliog, sharing Dropbox links is easy and browsing is fast–you can even make the app cache folders for quicker (or offline) access. Unbound will show you all the photo’s EXIF data and even show where a photo was taken on a map. Moving pictures between folders is easy, but I don’t think it’s possible to copy pictures to other albums. It shows me all my folders, but flattens the hierarchy–i.e., my month folders are no longer grouped by year. The ordering is correct, so this isn’t actually so bad.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>The next step for my photo management system is to integrate the rest of our family photos. Right now they’re scattered across several computers, folders and hard drives with tons of duplicates. Dropping these photos into my Camera Uploads folder will immediately sort them into my master folder structure, but it won’t remove duplicates. There are lots of apps out there that promise to remove duplicates, but I’m scared to death that they’ll remove too much and the one app I tried (<a href="http://www.duplicatephotofixer.com/PhotoCleaner.aspx">Photos Duplicate Cleaner</a>) didn’t come close to catching everything. </p>

<p>In the early days of the internet, companies like Yahoo tried organizing the web by manually creating big hiearchical lists of sites. Now we just Google for what we want and leave it to racks of servers and fancy algorithms to index it. The same thing has happened to mail. I used to carefully file all my mail into topic-specific folders, but now I just dump it all into one archive folder and rely on search when I need to find something. Photos will eventually be handled the same way. People won’t have to spend gobs of time dividing stacks of photos into events or tagging photos with their friends’ names–that’s what EXIF data and face recognition are for.  Everpix (may they rest in peace) was moving in this direction and I’ve heard <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/12/honan-photography/">great things about what Google+ is doing with pictures</a>. </p>

<p>I am very excited to try some more cutting edge services as they roll out. With our photos safely backed up and accessible on Dropbox, I won’t have to worry about being locked into a deadend or that the service will mess up my photos.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ll have the best of both worlds.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For the record, Everpix did both: they made export very difficult and compressed photos, losing detail that I might eventually want. <a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great products get reviewed and talked about, but great features of good products often fly under the radar. They can seem obvious in hindsight or just have a niche group that really appreciates them. Here are three of my favorites that deserve more notice.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-control-center.png" /></p>

<p><strong>1. Control Center</strong></p>

<p>Hands down my favorite new feature of iOS 7, the Control Center removes lots of little dead moments from my life. Every night I lock my phone into portrait mode when I get in bed. I use the flashlight at least twice a day. I select an Airplay destination or use the music controls about twice a day. And in the morning I free up the phone’s orientation again. Since I don’t even have to unlock the phone to do any of this, it saves me at least five seconds each time. That adds up to a minimum of 30 seconds a day and three whole hours a year.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-whispersync.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>2. Whispersync</strong></p>

<p>After the kids go to sleep and I’m cleaning the kitchen or putting toys away, I like to listen to audiobooks. When it’s particularly gripping, I continue to read the book on my phone in bed using the Kindle app. Whispersync means I automatically pick up right where I left off on the audio. The next night when I start listening again, the Audible app jumps to where I was in the e-book. I can’t imagine too many people take advantage of this, but I love it. </p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-sneeze-shield.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>3. Sneeze Shield</strong></p>

<p>Maybe our bedroom is dusty. Maybe I have allergies. Maybe I get a lot of low-grade colds. I don’t know why I sneeze a few times almost every morning when I wake up, but I do. And with two little kids, we all get our share of normal-grade colds. This means we go through a lot of tissues. Sneeze Shield means the tissue doesn’t fall apart when a grown up blows into it. I don’t miss handfuls of wet snot at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Note: You might want to read <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/09/im-not-happy/">my first photo management rant</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/04/30/pq1-adobe-revel-and-everpix">Part 1</a> for context.)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-loom.png" /></p>

<p>Ever since
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">Everpix went belly up</a>,
photo management has been a common topic on the blogs I read and the
podcasts I listen to. The current
<a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/our-favorite-photo-stream-alternative/">consensus favorite</a>
is <a href="http://www.loom.com">Loom</a> and when I read their feature list I was
pretty excited. They seemlessly sync your iOS Camera Roll and your Mac’s
iPhoto Library with the cloud. Unlike Everpix, they store original files
instead of lossy compressed versions. Unlike Everpix and Adobe Revel,
they store photos AND videos. Their web app lets you browse your photo
collection from anywhere. I loved that you could create and manage
albums of photos from anywhere. Even their pricing ($40/yr for 50GB and
$99/yr for 255GB) was reasonable.</p>

<p>I signed up for the service, and while it took longer than I thought it
should, the iOS app eventually pushed my 300 photo Camera Roll up to the
cloud.  After enjoyably browsing this little collection on my phone,
iPad, and Mac (using the web app), I decided to pony up for a month of 255GB
of storage and try uploading my whole iPhoto library.  I won’t bore you
with the details, but after six days of synchronization hangs, duplicate
photos, and unanswered support email, I gave up.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the problem was just me as I haven’t found anyone
else complaining about Loom synchronization on the web.  My internet
connection’s upload speed is not that great–just 1.5 Mbps–but this is
the first time I’ve had a product give me trouble. Dropbox has been
successfully syncing more than 50 GB of files for about three years now
and I have used BackBlaze to successfully replicate about a terabyte of data.</p>

<p>I found the whole experience rather depressing. The service even on paper
wasn’t perfect. They don’t remove duplicate photos. They don’t offer
even rudimentary editing tools. They won’t stream videos through any of
their apps. They won’t synchronize folders on Windows machines with the
cloud. That said, their feature set was above my bar and they seemed
like they were moving in the right direction.  This time software
quality was the show stopper. </p>

<p>Sigh. The quest continues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-scepter-and-crown.jpg" /></p>

<p>R turned five this weekend and we celebrated with a party, some amazing cupcakes, a trip to the carousel, and a brand new <a href="/blog/11/21/non-violent-dungeons-and-dragons-for-kids/">Nonviolent Dungeons and Dragons for Kids</a> adventure. This one was more puzzle-based and less monster-focused than The Haunted Castle. It was also a little longer and more open to different routes through it.</p>

<p><strong>Props (all optional)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>a scepter</li>
  <li>a crown</li>
  <li>Some sort of horn</li>
  <li>box with coins and jewels</li>
  <li>frog boots</li>
  <li>rope</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>King Ricardo (your father, if you&rsquo;re a princess) has a special mission for you: You must deliver this scepter and crown to your cousin Princess Soldina for her birthday in three days. He gives you a <a href="/images/nvdndfk/land-of-the-scepter-and-the-crown-map.pdf">map of the area</a>&ndash;it looks very far and there is no direct route. The King then smiles and gives the players a beautiful magic flying carpet. He says it is very fast and should get you there in plenty of time. It will also return to the King as soon as you step off of it.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p>Your flight is very pleasant until you start to cross the Black Mountains. That&rsquo;s when a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)">roc</a> notices you and starts swooping in for a closer look.</p>

<p>What do you do? </p>

<p>The player can try to avoid each roc capture attempt by rolling 3d6 under her dexterity, but eventually the roc will get them. If they roll exactly their dexterity, they fall and just barely grab the edge of the carpet where they are gently plucked off by the roc.</p>

<p><strong>1. The roc&rsquo;s cave</strong></p>

<p>The roc flies north and brings you to her nest and then flies off again, in search more food for her chicks. The nest is in a cave high on a mountain (see <a href="/images/nvdndfk/land-of-the-scepter-and-the-crown-dm-map.pdf">DM&rsquo;s version of the map of the land</a>).  There are two hungry baby rocs in the nest.  They don&rsquo;t like jokes, but can be soothed to sleep with a lullaby. The cave entrance is a cliff dropping thousands of feet to sharp rocks. You get a little dizzy looking down. In the back of the cave, it looks like a tunnel goes further into the mountain.</p>

<p>There is a weird glowing mold growing on almost all the walls of the caverns that provides enough light to see.</p>

<p>The DM should draw the roc&rsquo;s cave on a blank sheet of paper for the players and extend the map as the players explore without showing <a href="/images/nvdndfk/caverns-of-the-scepter-and-the-crown-dm-map.pdf">his own complete map of the caverns</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. The abandoned bedroom</strong></p>

<p>It looks like someone has been living in here recently, but they aren&rsquo;t here now. There are dirty clothes and some fresh food and drink.  If the players search the room, they will also find a long coil of silk rope, a sharp knife, and some magic green boots with frog eyes on the toes.  These will let the wearer jump long distances.</p>

<p><strong>3. The giant spider nest</strong></p>

<p>The giant spider is working in the back of a giant web&ndash;she is busily wrapping her silk around something large and doesn&rsquo;t notice the players. In fact, she has caught Boris, the human who lived in the bedroom on food stolen from the roc&rsquo;s babies.  He made his rope from the spider&rsquo;s silk, but he got too close to the spider recently.  The group may try to rescue him, though the spider is a tough opponent. She is scared of fire though. The web is extremely sticky.  Players will need to either be very strong to escape or use a knife to get out.</p>

<p><strong>4. The chasm</strong></p>

<p>The bridge that once crossed this chasm broke long ago.  Players will need the frog boots and possibly rope to get across. The cave turns into a tunnel on the other side and winds down for a long way on the other side to the underground river.</p>

<p><strong>5. The underground river</strong></p>

<p>The tunnel opens up into a small cave with a low ceiling and a fast-moving river running through it. Next to the river is a small boat. If you want to make the adventure tougher, you could put a hole in the boat and make the players figure out a way to repair it. The river flows underground for several miles and then exits the mountain flowing another several miles to the ocean. Show players on the King&rsquo;s map.</p>

<p>Just before the river takes a sharp turn and joins the ocean is an unusual multi-colored arched rock about the size of a horse. It is called rainbow rock, but the players don&rsquo;t know that yet. It can&rsquo;t be seen directly from the ocean.</p>

<p><strong>6. The Pirates</strong></p>

<p>After being swept past the odd arch-shaped rock, the players&rsquo; boat is caught in the ocean&rsquo;s current moving south.  They soon encounter a pirate ship.  The pirates (led by Pink Beard) are a rough crew but not very hostile.  They are looking for a treasure chest that is supposed to be buried under something called Rainbow Rock.  The pirates have been unable to find it thus far. The players have the option of telling the pirates where it is or keeping quiet.</p>

<p><strong>7. Rainbow Rock</strong></p>

<p>If the players dig under the rainbow rock, they will find a treasure chest. Inside are gold coins, jewels, and a horn covered with intricately carved animals of all kinds.  It is a magical Horn of Animal Summoning.  When blown, some animal will come to the aid of the player.  Some animals are more helpful than others. Aquarius the whale will come if the players blow the horn at this point. He can tow their boat along with the chest all the way to Princess Soldina&rsquo;s Castle in time for the birthday party.</p>

<p><strong>How it went</strong></p>

<p>R started by creating a new Princess character and enjoyed coloring her map of land throughout her adventure. R was initially very cautious exploring the caves&ndash;I had to goad her into moving down the tunnels&ndash;but by the end she was feeling quite comfortable underground. She was also wary of the frog boots and certainly didn&rsquo;t want to tangle with the giant spider. The whole adventure took about half an hour and my favorite moment was at the very end, when she said &ldquo;Can we play another story now?&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-d-and-d-fun.jpg" /></p>

<p>My daughter R spends half of her life in a fantasy world pretending she is either a pony, a cat, a princess, a fairy, or some combination of these. She also loves reading about fantastical adventures like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonderful-Wizard-Oz-Anniversary-Wonder/dp/0060293233">The Wizard of Oz</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comet-Moominland-Tove-Jansson/dp/0312608888">Comet in Moominland</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bravest-Knight-Mercer-Mayer/dp/0803732066">The Bravest Knight</a>. So when a friend sent me <a href="http://gygaxmagazine.com/2013/08/09/dming-for-your-toddler/">Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s account</a> of how he plays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_and_dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> (D&amp;D) with his four year old daughter, I got very excited. A game that has players pretending they are characters exploring mythical lands and fighting fabulous monsters seemed like an almost perfect match. Cory simplified the rules to fit into a little kid attention span, but there was still a problem: We run a nonviolent household and a game that revolves around bloodshed is a nonstarter.</p>

<p>In middle school, I played a lot of D&amp;D. Sometimes I&rsquo;d play with friends who were all about the monsters, the combat, and the treasure.  Sometimes I played with friends who set up a vivid land, an intricate plot, and complex characters. These games revolved around solving mysteries, working together, and the occasional backstabbing. We stepped into another world when we played and while combat happened, it was just a small piece of the puzzle. This was the experience I wanted to share with R.</p>

<p>After some experimentation, I think we&rsquo;ve come up with a decent set of rules and R is still talking about our last adventure (&ldquo;The Haunted Castle&rdquo;). I&rsquo;ve written up our rules and a description of that adventure here so we don&rsquo;t forget them and also for anyone else who might want to take the plunge. The biggest innovation is the replacement of the combat system with an &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; system.  Instead of fighting monsters, we try to befriend them or avoid them. And while the monsters might try to scare players or even imprison them, no one can actually hurt anyone.</p>

<h2 id="creating-characters">Creating Characters</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/nvdndfk/character-sheet.png" /></p>

<p>Cory Doctorow wanted get his daughter adventuring as quickly as possible, and so had her make up a bare bones character up front, fleshing her out as needed during the game. We found that creating a character was one of the most riveting parts of the game. I pre-printed some character sheets (<a href="/images/nvdndfk/character-sheet.docx">.docx</a>, <a href="/images/nvdndfk/character-sheet.pdf">.pdf</a>) and R enjoyed rolling dice, writing down numbers, and drawing her character&rsquo;s picture. We started by choosing the character&rsquo;s name, race, and job.  Races include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>human,</li>
  <li>fairy (can fly),</li>
  <li>elf (good at hiding and finding), </li>
  <li>dwarf (can sniff out gems), and </li>
  <li>hobbit (can squeeze into small spaces). </li>
</ul>

<p>Possible jobs are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>princess (good at horseback riding), </li>
  <li>knight (also good on horses), and </li>
  <li>wizard (casting spells). </li>
</ul>

<p>There are no functional differences between knights and princesses just in case we end up playing with boys some time in the future. I didn&rsquo;t think thieves or clerics were kid-appropriate.</p>

<p>Each character has three attributes: </p>

<ul>
  <li>strength, </li>
  <li>intelligence, and</li>
  <li>dexterity.</li>
</ul>

<p>These affect the characters&rsquo; chances of doing things like finding traps, climbing obstacles, jumping over things, or pushing/lifting things.  I had R roll three six-sided dice (aka 3d6) three times and each time decide which attribute she wanted that roll to be. I also let her roll again if she got a really low number.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be adding new races, jobs and attributes as we play more. </p>

<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>

<p>Wizards start off with one spell, but anyone can find and use scrolls with spells.  Possible spells currently include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rainbow (can impress or distract monsters)</li>
  <li>Sleep (can put monsters to sleep for 10 minutes)</li>
  <li>Universal language (allows character to speak to any animate creature)</li>
  <li>Smoke cloud (good for creating diversions)</li>
  <li>Invisibility (lasts one hour)</li>
  <li>Flight (lasts one hour)</li>
  <li>Super strength (lasts one hour)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h2>

<p>The sky is the limit on magical items that can be found in the course of the adventure.  R already has a Wand of Stone (that turns living creatures to stone) and a Bracelet of Teleportation (that works once per day).</p>

<h2 id="basic-game-play">Basic Game Play</h2>

<p>Every adventure has a big goal.  The player(s) have to do something like rescue someone, find something, or stop someone. In our first adventure, the party had to rescue a princess that had been kidnapped by a giant frog army and brought to a volcano.  Our second involved helping the frog army (now our friends) get back to their home pond through a magic tunnel. The players always start somewhere specific and get a short description of what&rsquo;s going on.  Then I say &ldquo;What do you do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cory&rsquo;s fairly improvisational method can work well if you have a great imagination and a library of &ldquo;situations&rdquo; you can bring to bear.  I&rsquo;ve found I do better with a little bit of preparation&ndash; not nearly as much as you would need to run a game with older kids or adults, but more than none. Our third adventure (&ldquo;The Haunted Castle&rdquo;) is described below. Be inspired by books (yours and his/hers) and movies. These are great sources for monsters, characters, situations, and plots.</p>

<p>Some sort of board or map is very useful in anchoring the action.  We used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Large-Neat-Oh-Dinosaur-Dinosauria-Figures/dp/B0080IUTN2">dinosaur landscape</a> first and then just a hand-drawn map of a castle. If you have a big pad of paper (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Easel-Paper-Pad/dp/B00365OLU6">Melissa and Doug&rsquo;s Easel Pad</a>), you can quickly draw anything you want.</p>

<p>As the action unfolds, we do a lot of ad hoc dice rolling. This definitely adds an element of excitement. If you don&rsquo;t have dice, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS">Chessex Pound of Dice</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been keeping track of who we befriend during each adventure and counting them up.  This might eventually be a decent analog of experience points (traditionally acquiring by killing monsters) but we haven&rsquo;t used these numbers for anything yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-interaction-system">The Interaction System</h2>

<p>When a player comes into contact with a creature, they can do anything except attack.  Possible actions include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greet the creature</li>
  <li>Give a present</li>
  <li>Smile</li>
  <li>Tell a joke</li>
  <li>Sing a friendship song</li>
  <li>Run away</li>
  <li>Use a spell</li>
</ul>

<p>If the player decides to tell a joke or sing, they must actually do so. The joke or song must also be relevant to the situation at hand. If the player&rsquo;s action is friendly, they roll a die. The size depends on the quality of the action&ndash;e.g., a good joke gets a greater die. The creature also rolls a die equal to his/her &ldquo;friendship resistance points.&rdquo; More ornery creatures roll bigger dice. The highest number wins.  If the monster wins, s/he stays ornery and doesn&rsquo;t cooperate.  If the player wins, the monster becomes a friend.  No one ever gets hurt.  If friends are helping, they can roll dice too.</p>

<h2 id="the-haunted-castle">The Haunted Castle</h2>

<p>All descriptions and scenarios in this adventure benefit from extemperaneous elaboration&ndash;think of everything below as a jumping off point. The main goals are exploration and escape, and the only way out of the castle is to find and use the Bracelet of Teleportation.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/nvdndfk/the-haunted-castle-map.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Props:</strong></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need any props, but in general, with little kids, the more props the better.  This set worked well for us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a big hand-drawn copy of <a href="/images/the-haunted-castle-map.pdf">the castle map</a> (you can also use a real doll house)</li>
  <li>a way to dim the lights</li>
  <li>spooky music and sound effects (the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dj-halloween/id337499264">DJ Halloween iPhone app</a> is awesome)</li>
  <li>a fancy box (doubles as jewelry box and treasure chest)</li>
  <li>a bracelet</li>
  <li>a key</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day you were out exploring the Tangled Forest and there arose a terrible storm in the late afternoon. In the heavy rain, you couldn&rsquo;t see much, but then there was a flash of lightning and it illuminated a castle to your left on a hill. It looks dark and foreboding but you need shelter. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the player moves closer to the castle they see flickering lights in the windows. The castle is made of heavy gray stone and is surrounded by a moat. Strange dangerous creatures seem to be swimming in the moat. On the right side of the castle rises a tall tower. A drawbridge slowly lowers.</p>

<p><strong>The five rooms of the castle (<a href="/images/nvdndfk/the-haunted-castle-map.pdf">.pdf map</a>):</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. The Great Room</strong></p>

<p>Once inside the castle, the drawbridge slams closed and three skeletons (FR points = 1d6 each) appear and laugh.  They tell the player she is trapped. The room is dark but has torches on the left and right walls.  On each side of the room are two doors. R made friends with these skeletons right away, but they aren&rsquo;t very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Kitchen</strong></p>

<p>Three witches are huddled in a corner around a big bubbling cauldron with their backs to the door.  They are completely engrossed in cackling and stirring, and won&rsquo;t notice a player until the player talks to them. Until they are befriended (FR points = 1d6 each), they will threaten to turn the player into a rat even though they won&rsquo;t actually do it. They also won&rsquo;t chase the player out of the room.</p>

<p>Once befriended, they can&rsquo;t answer any questions, but they will refer the player to the rats in the dining room and offer up a universal language scroll so the player can talk to them.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Dining Room</strong> </p>

<p>The room is dominated by a huge table covered with rotting food on beautiful plates and big bowls of boiling stews. It smells terrible and there are rats sneaking around in the corners. As the rats get comfortable, they will hop on the table to steal food and drinks.</p>

<p>The rats here know a lot, and they can answer direct questions, but they usually run away after they answer them. Of course, you need the universal language spell to talk to them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q: How can I escape? A: You need the magic bracelet&ndash;it can transport you anywhere in an instant.</li>
  <li>Q: Where is the bracelet? A: In the dungeon&ndash;but don&rsquo;t open the wrong chest!</li>
  <li>Q: Where is the key to the chest? A: In the tower&ndash;but don&rsquo;t wake up the vampire!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. The Dungeon</strong></p>

<p>The dungeon is dark&ndash;the player must bring a torch from upstairs or she won&rsquo;t be able to see a thing.  The stairs are long and the dungeon is deep underground. The ceilings are low. The dungeon itself is filled with rubble, broken furniture, and loads of cob webs.  It&rsquo;s more like a messy basement than a true dungeon, but it&rsquo;s still scary.</p>

<p>In the far corner lie two large ornate chests. They look much fancier after the dust has been blown or brushed off.  One is unlocked and inside is a mummy (FR=1d12). He moves slowly and just says &ldquo;Leave me alone! Leave my dungeon&rdquo; over and over.</p>

<p>The second chest is locked and can only be opened with the key from the tower.  It contains gold coins, gems, and the Bracelet of Teleportation which will take the player home.</p>

<p><strong>5. The Tower</strong></p>

<p>The stairs to the top of the tower are long and they lead to a heavy unlocked wooden door. The player must roll 3d6 lower than their strength to push it open. Entering the room, the player sees an old decrepit bedroom. The bed is wrought iron with chipped paint and dirty white silk canopy. Sleeping on his back with his arms crossed over his chest is a vampire. He has pale white skin and two sharp canines protruding from his mouth.</p>

<p>As the player walks around the room, she makes noise stepping on broken glass and knocking things off dressers. These noises wake up the vampire if she rolls a 6 on a d6.  Otherwise the vampire simply moves and groans. In a jewelry box on a table next to the bed is the key that opens the locked dungeon chest.</p>

<p>If the vampire wakes up, he is very angry and has 1d20 friendship resistance points. At this point, the player should notice the jewelry box. If she still doesn&rsquo;t grab it, the vampire should throw it at her, miss, and have it smash on the stairs revealing the key. The vampire will chase them down the stairs, but not into the dungeon. </p>

<p>Happy adventuring!</p>
