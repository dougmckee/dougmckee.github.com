  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I went to <a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com/">a local shop</a> and
bought new tires for the mountain bike I ride around town almost every
day.  The angst I felt while deciding exactly what to buy took me by
surprise.  Part of me wanted something cheap and durable that would roll
smoothly and efficiently on pavement. But another part of me wanted to
replace my worn out racing tires with something aggressive, knobby and
impractical for city streets.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenties and thirties the bike I rode defined me more
than my sunglasses, my haircut, or my car. It was more than my
style—it was a major part of my identity. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but imagine what a truck guy’s truck means to him or what an
Apple nerd’s Mac means to him (or her).  A good friend of mine would
call me regularly and say “Got time for some tire talk?”  We would spend
the next half hour dissecting the pros and cons of different treads;
analyzing the tracks we saw out on the trails; debating whether Kevlar
worth the price premium; discussing trends like “thin on the bottom,
knobby on the sides”, and arguing about what tire shed mud or carved
corners best.  At the end though, the most important question was: “What
are you riding right now?”</p>

<p>Since I hit my forties my life has changed a lot.  I spend the vast
majority of my time working, parenting, or doing house stuff.  Trail
riding (and even trail-running) is mostly on hiatus.  My daylight
leisure time is almost always having fun with the girls and when they’re
sleeping at night I’d rather blog than ride.  In a few years (when the girls are
older) I’m sure I’ll be back, but until then, my riding will be limited
to the streets between my offices and classrooms.  This is far far
better than nothing–I actually love battling traffic and the elements.</p>

<p>So it’s been years since my bike’s gotten dirty, but up until last week,
I still had the option of veering onto any trail and cutting through East
Rock Park at a moment’s notice.  And I liked projecting the image of an
MTB guy on his way to a trailhead (even if I was wearing a corduroy
jacket).  Those days are over.  I chose a pair of
<a href="http://www.kendausa.com/en/home/bicycle/commuter.aspx">cheap tires</a>
that ride way better than my old knobbies on the road.  They even
have a little bit of a tread that could handle some of the East Rock
trails.  But now I’m honest with myself and world.  I’m a bike commuter.
It’s not permanent, but it’s true.  And I’m good with that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have heard that Apple announced a new iPad this week and that
they released a version of iPhoto that runs on iPads and iPhones. Most
folks seem to
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/07/iphoto-for-ios">like it quite a bit</a>,
while a few people have complained that it’s
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/iphoto-confusion/">unintuitive</a> with
all its mysterious icons and gestures.  The problems with Apple’s
“system” for managing and editing photos go much deeper and I find it
incredibly frustrating because Apple has all the pieces for something
truly fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Crappy About the Current System:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The new iPhoto doesn’t run on the original iPad. I get it that I’m in
the minority of people who like to buy a product and run into into the
ground before upgrading.  And I get it that it that some of the filters
might be a little slow.  But Adobe Photoshop Express runs well.  I think
their public reasoning is that the experience on my iPad would be
sub-par.  And it conveniently gives me another reason to upgrade.
Fine.  I’ll give Apple a pass on this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are Photos and iPhoto separate apps?  I would understand if
iPhoto had a superset of Photos’ features, but it doesn’t.  Photos
allows me to move photos between albums, create new albums, and do some
minor editing.  iPhoto has more powerful editing tools and lets me share
photos with friends in different ways, but it doesn’t manage albums.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any album management you do with Photos doesn’t get sync’ed back to
the desktop version of iPhoto.  So why would I possibly go to the
trouble of organizing my photos on the phone itself?  I would say this
was a bug, but it’s been there since iOS 5 was released in October.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photo Stream is a feature that doesn’t fit into my work flow.  I can
easily access all the photos I’ve taken over the last 30 days on any of
my devices.  If I want a photo that I took earlier than that, I must
have moved it someplace more permanent during that 30 day window or I
have to go back to the device where I took the picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t easily share photos between my Mac and my wife’s PC.  While
Apple might think this increases the chance that she will upgrade to a
Mac one of the days, this sort of thing just makes her dig her feet in
and resent the “Apple’s walled garden” even more than she already does.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Would Be a Lot Better:</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way.  My perfect world looks more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto stores all my photos (and albums and events) in iCloud and
replicates them on my Mac.  Besides giving me a central repository that
I can access from anywhere, it’s also my off-site backup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iPhoto gets merged with the Photos app and it also accesses my photos
in iCloud.  This means any organization I do (e.g., moving photos
between albums) happens in one place: iCloud.  It also means that I
don’t have to actually store all the photos (and home video clips) on
the device itself—it can stream them as needed and manage a cache of
them so it seems fast.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apple provides a web app for browsing and organizing photos that
could be used from a PC.  Even better, they would open up the iCloud API
so someone could write a version of iPhoto for the PC that used the same
iCloud photo store, but that seems unlikely to happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photostream gets replaced by something simpler that just dumps all
photos taken by my devices into my iCloud photo store.  If they get
grouped as events (ala desktop iPhoto import) they’ll be easy to find
when I want to organize them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This dream system isn’t easy to build, but it’s not impossible either.
I just hope that Apple isn’t sitting there thinking their current system
is good enough or that it just needs a few minor tweeks.  And I really
hope that some improvements are in the pipeline.  If iOS 6 isn’t a lot
better, I might just have to switch my photo management to Google
Picasa.  And this Apple fan-boi certainly doesn’t want to do that.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-05T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 5<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Beatles played mostly sugary upbeat pop songs.  They have <em>at least
three</em> songs about good mornings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They sang that “All You Need is
Love” and “Octopus’s Garden” and “Yellow Submarine”.  The whole band
spent time in India getting in tune with their spiritual sides.  John
went on to “imagine all the people living life in peace” while Paul sang
“Ebony and Ivory” with Stevie Wonder.</p>

<p>All that’s true.  And so is the fact that they had a creepy obsession
with violence against women and serial killers.  It all started in 1965
with <em>Rubber Soul</em>’s final track: “Run for Your Life”.  I’ll lyrics
speak for themselves:</p>

<pre>
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man 
That's the end'a little girl
</pre>

<p>They followed this in 1967 with Sgt. Pepper’s “Getting Better”.  I loved
this song when I was a kid and thought nothing of these lines:</p>

<pre>
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart 
  from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, things were not getting better.  In 1968 the Beatles
released the White Album which was full of songs that went on to inspire
renowned serial killer Charles Manson.  The lyrics to Manson’s favorite
song (“Helter Skelter”) are a little opaque (e.g., “When I get to the
bottom I go back to the top of the slide”) but Manson sure knew what
they meant.</p>

<p>And finally, on the last album they recorded together (<em>Abbey Road</em>),
the Beatles transparently glamourized a serial killer named Maxwell
Edison who by the end of the song bludgeons to death two women and a
male magistrate:</p>

<pre>
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
</pre>

<p>The Beatles were an incredibly talented and versatile band.  They’ve
inspired countless musicians over the years.  Perhaps it’s time to give
them credit for inspiring some 1990’s sicko metal (and nü-metal)
bands like Slayer and Korn too.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-04T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 4<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It turns out there is a lot of confusion out there about what exactly
professors do over spring break. My neighbors think I’m on my way to the
beach and my students don’t know what to think. So let’s put this
mystery to rest with a top 10 list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Catch up on research. During the semester if you have a less than
productive research day there are no short term consequences.  On the
other hand, if you don’t prep you lecture for the next day you look
pretty silly standing up in front of your class with nothing to
say. That’s a recipe for falling behind on research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grade the exams students took the week before break and the
papers students passed in right before they left for Daytona.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write referee reports. Part of our job is to evaluate our peers’ work and
either suggest improvements or make the case that the project is
hopeless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attend conferences.  These are often conveniently scheduled when we
don’t have to work around classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect data in the field. I don’t do much of this, but if I did,
this is when I’d do it. Preferably someplace warm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recover some sleep. We don’t get enough during the semester either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See family. These might be members in our own homes that we didn’t
see enough or grandparents that live in another state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prep classes for after break. It’s always nice to start the second
half with a few lectures in the bank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>File taxes. If you’re extremely lucky you have another professor in
your household that’s willing to do this.  (Thank you!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blog a little more. We can always dream!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So is spring break vacation?  Kind of, but not really since we work almost
every day.  It’s still nice change of pace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m a little embarrassed to say there were three important omissions
from my monster book review article. So without further ado:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jillian-Jiggs-Rescue-Phoebe-Gilman/dp/0439460298">Jillian Jiggs to the Rescue</a>:
Jillian’s little sister is afraid of a monster so Jillian and her
friends build a monster machine to shrink it and smash it into
meatloaf.  It’s a little violent for my taste, but R loves it and there
is a good twist at the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thats-Monster-Usborne-Touchy-Feely-Books/dp/0794528783">That’s Not My Monster</a>:
My 10-month-old loves this book with all it’s textures and cuteness
though I think it does run a close second to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thats-Lion-THATS-LION-TOUCH-Board/dp/B0070LANR2">That’s Not My Lion</a> in
the series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Sesame-Street-Little-Golden/dp/037582913X">There’s a Monster at the End of This Book!</a>:
I absolutely loved this book when I was a kid and R definitely enjoys
laughing at Grover at the end.  Just don’t get me started on <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/17560395436/e-books-and-kids">the iPhone

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I write because I’ve learned or created something interesting
that I want to share. Sometimes I write because I’m so appalled by
something I need to get it off my chest. But rarely is it both. About a
week ago I was ready to write a scathing post describing my really great
but really unstable home music system.  Things are a lot better now, but
I still wanted to share.</p>

<p>The hardware is a combination of old Apple parts and stereo equipment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An Airport Express that I bought on eBay for $55 connected to an old
Bose Acoustic Wave (also bought on eBay) in the kitchen </li>
  <li>An iMac in the office with my entire 76 GB music collection stored in mp3’s
and de-drm’ed AAC files</li>
  <li>A 1.0 AppleTV connected to a traditional stereo system in the
living room </li>
</ul>

<p>With this set up, I run iTunes on the Mac and can have it play in any
or all of the three locations at any time.  With the Remote iPhone app,
I can control it from anywhere in the house.  Sounds nice, right?
Unfortunately, I would have to reboot my wireless router (a 2wire from
Uverse) a couple times a day because the Remote app would spontaneously
stop talking to the Mac. And then a few times a week I would have to
reboot the Mac because it would stop talking to the kitchen Airport
Express and the living room AppleTV.  Grr….</p>

<p>I had no idea what was going on until I stopped using the Parallels
virtual machine software on the Mac. I had been running MS Office in a
Windows 7 vm, but finally got sick of the quirks and just installed the Mac
native version of Office. It took me a couple weeks to notice that I
never had to reboot the router again. Damn you Parallels!  I don’t know
how you messed up the network, but you did!  Then I noticed that the
Mac only stopped talking to the other devices when I used the Yale
VPN. And when I got off and even quit out of the Cisco VPN app, it
<em>still</em> couldn’t connect until I rebooted.  Two applications messing up
the network?  Hmm….makes me wonder if maybe a bug in the OS is to
blame.</p>

<p>So as of today, I still don’t know why those two apps were causing
problems, but I don’t have any more surprises. I don’t use Parallels and
I always reboot after using the VPN.  This keeps the 80’s music
flowing. The system still isn’t perfect. I want to add another output
node in the basement. I want to install Airfoil and stream Spotify
throughout the house. And the Remote app takes way longer than it should
to connect when it starts. But for the most part, I can listen to
whatever I want wherever I want and that makes me happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Jared Diamond’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552">Guns Germs and Steel</a>,
he asserts that zebras cause more injuries to zoo keepers than any other
animal. At least that’s how I remember it–I gave my copy away years ago
and never replaced it. In any event, it’s common knowledge that <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Woman-bitten-by-Zebra.jpg">zebras are mean</a> and you can’t really tame them. Horses on the other hand are
every little girl’s best friend and they are happy to wear <a href="http://michellewrighton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dsc_4039.jpg">garlands of flowers</a> and <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2659658105_d8bccd69f1.jpg">nibble apples out of your hand</a>.  Why such a difference when
on the surface zebras just seem like striped horses?</p>

<p>Before I go any further I should say that the rest of this post is a
pure mixture of Wikipedia and armchair theorizing. You have been warned.</p>

<p>The answer has to be geography. The savanna is a
<a href="http://babeinthebush.blogspot.com/2009/08/luangwa-battlefield-of-hippo-part-5.html">tough place</a>. It’s
got cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs (that also make <a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/stories/animalsnature/african-wild-dogs/">terrible pets</a>),
crocodiles (near the water anyway) and of course lions. Friendly and
laid back on the savanna equals dead. You have to be fierce
(zebras/meerkats), big (elephants/hippos/rhinos/giraffes) or fast and
high strung (impalas and ostriches) to survive.  But what about those friendly
monkeys that like to sit on shoulders in the bazaar?  Don’t they live on
the savanna? Well they can watch the action from the tops of trees and
eat their bananas in peace.  Zebras don’t have that option.</p>

<p>The temperate grasslands where horses evolved are a whole different
story. A lot more empty space and a lot fewer predators mean horses
could afford to just horse around all day before humans came along and
domesticated them.  Even the
<a href="http://www.fws.gov/rockymountainarsenal/kids/puzzles/PredatorsofthePrairie.pdf">temperate grassland predators</a>
are basically wild house pets. Wolves are genetically identical to dogs
and nothing else is big enough to give a horse more than a kick in the
shin.</p>

<p>Of course this very reasonable explanation doesn’t change the fact that
it’s grossly unfair that we can’t ride zebras around for fun–I mean
that would be so cool!  Maybe someday someone will splice nice genes
into the zebra (or striped genes into the horse) and I’ll get to live
the dream. Until then I’ll stick to the mountain bike for my riding
adventures. Oh well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My three-year old daughter (R) is afraid of a variety of unusual things
(like vacuum cleaners, our old housekeeper, Mango the stuffed monkey,
and toy drills) and a few usual things (like the doctor) but for the
most part she’s pretty brave.  She loves all animals and creepy
crawlies, and neither the dark nor heights phase her.  Halloween is her
favorite holiday and she still likes when we joke about all the
vampires, mummies, and witches that live in the cemetary we drive by on
our way to school.  And some of her favorite books are about monsters.
Most of these books seem to be written to help kids get over fears of
monsters, but R just thinks they are hilarious.  We recently came back
from the library with a whole stack of monster books and it got me
thinking about our all-time favorites.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Bed-Jeanne-Willis/dp/0688068049">The Monster Bed</a>:
A monster named Dennis is afraid of humans.  We still call all monsters
the monsters in our house Dennis.  The art and rhymes are both great.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theres-Nightmare-Closet-Pied-Piper/dp/0140547126">There’s a Nightmare in My Closet</a>:
Mercer Mayer wrote this long before he achieved fame and fortune with
his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Baby-Mercer-Mayer/dp/0307119424">Critter</a>
books and it has a little bit of an edge. Like many other books on
this list, it starts with a kid afraid of monsters and ends with the
monster being pretty nice.  In the middle, the kid fires his gun at the
monster.  The monster cries, the kid feels bad, and next thing you know
they are cuddled up in bed together.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterson-Puppies-Midnight-Monster-Party/dp/0763632430">The Patterson Puppies and the Midnight Monster Party</a>:
A puppy named Petra is scared of a monster that roams the house at night
and neither her parents nor her three siblings can help her feel safe.
But then they make a bunch of cookies and have a big party!  A good time
is had by all (including the monster) until mom and dad show up and send
them back to bed.  My daughter has this book at school and was so
excited when she found it at the library.  Our own copy from Amazon is
on its way now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Over-Hollow-Rebecca-Dickinson/dp/0811850358">Over in the Hollow</a>:
The old song “Over in the Meadow” has been remade to death by children’s
book authors, but this version never gets old.  We’re so lucky the vampires
haven’t turned R into a biter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goblin-Empty-Chair-Mem-Fox/dp/B003IWYJHM">The Goblin and the Empty Chair</a>:
Lots of kids books have two sets of jokes: one for the kids and one for
the grown-ups that are along for the ride.  This book has two stories.
My daughter thinks it’s about a goblin who thinks he is ugly, helps
some people, and then joins them for dinner.  She has no idea that the
family that the goblin helps is mourning the death of their son.  Seriously, this is
the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081283/">Ordinary People</a> picture
book.  It sounds crazy, but it works.  And the art is awesome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birthday-Monsters-Boynton-Board-Sandra/dp/1563054434">Birthday Monsters!</a>:
This board book is geared toward a younger audience, but I still laugh
when I see the monsters raid the fridge during a game of hide-and-seek.
Sandra Boynton has so many good books, but this might be my favorite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Believe it or not, new wave isn’t dead.  It may not be popular anymore,
but several bands that haven’t had a hit in the US since the eighties
are still producing great music.  And I mean <strong>new</strong> music—they aren’t
just not milking their catalog for “new” remixes and playing the state
fair circuit in the summer.</p>

<p>While not all this new music is any good, you will be happy to know that
I’ve done the hard work of listening to it over the last couple weeks to
separate the wheat from the crap.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_League">The Human League</a> are
(is?) absolutely the most under-rated new wave band of the eighties.
About ten years ago I saw an eighties triple bill headlined by Boy
George. He was good, but the Human League were totally unexpectedly
fantastic. They nailed their old stuff (like (I’m Only) “Human”,
“Fascination”, and “Don’t You Want Me”) and their then new stuff (from
<em>Secrets</em> 2001) was just as good. It totally holds up today and I even
love their 2011 album <em>Credo</em>. Except for the more contemporary dance
beat on the lead track (Never Let Me Go) it could have been released in
1983.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys">The Pet Shop Boys</a>
disappeared from the US music scene at the end of the eighties, but,
just like Kylie Minogue, they have continued putting out hit album after
hit album in the UK.  They’re still sensitive and synthy but their music has
matured with them in a really good way.  My favorite of their recent
work is <em>Release</em> (2002), but the dance remixes of <em>Fundamental</em> (2006)
are a lot of fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey">Morrissey:</a> I loved the Smiths
and would have cried when they broke up if I hadn’t discovered them long
after the break-up had already happened.  Morrissey has amazingly just
continued to put out solid albums in the years since and thoroughly
proven that he was the talented one and that Johnny Marr (like Wham’s
Andrew Ridgely) was just along for the ride.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode">Depeche Mode</a> I’ll be
honest–I’m not one of those totally nutty Depeche Mode fans who believe
Dave Gahan is God.  And I left them behind after <em>Violator</em> (1989) even
though “Policy of Truth” is one of my all time favorite songs.  But they
do continue to produce music and I did take a chance on <em>Playing the
Angel</em> (2005).  It has one good track (“Precious”) and the rest is
crap.  Am I still bitter about that?  Yes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure">The Cure</a> The Cure are an
amazing band and certainly Robert Smith is closer to God than Dave
Gahan.  Their range, from minimalist early new wave to syrupy pop to
wall of sound, is impressive.  When I saw them in 2003, I was blown away
by Smith’s guitar playing of all things.  That said, I’m not a huge fan
of their recent stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears">Tears for Fears</a> Their
first two albums (<em>The Hurting</em> and <em>Songs from the Big Chair</em>) hold up
surprisingly well, but <em>Seeds of Love</em> was a little goofy even for me.
They broke up in 1991 and Roland Orzabal released two kind of lousy
albums still using the band’s name.  They got back together and released
<em>Everyone Loves a Happy Ending</em> in 2004 and I’ve tried to like it over
the past few days.  It sounds just like <em>Seeds of Love</em> and I’ll let you
decide if that’s good or bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Jones_(musician)">Howard Jones</a>
opened the same triple bill I mentioned above and I had such high hopes
since I absolutely played <em>Dream Into Action</em> into the ground when I was
in high school.  Shoot, I still listen to it all the time!
Unfortunately, the show was a big let down and everything he’s recorded
since <em>In the Running</em> (1992) is in my opinion unlistenable.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ha">A-ha!</a> Most American’s think of A-ha
as that one-hit wonder with the fun cartoony music video, but they
happen to be the biggest band ever out of Norway and just broke up in
2010.  It’s kind of hard to find their albums (read: they aren’t in the
iTunes Store), but they do have a greatest hits (<em>The Singles:
1984-2004)</em>) that I’ve been enjoying.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaville_(band)">Alphaville</a> Released in
1984, “Big in Japan” and “Forever Young” are absolutely quintessential
eighties new wave songs.  I have a soft spot for their second (less
successful) album, <em>Afternoons in Utopia</em> (1986) since I wore out the
the cassette I copied from my freshman dorm roommate.  But I just can’t
listen to anything they’ve released since.  And I’ve tried.</p>

<p>If you’ve managed to read to the bottom of this too-long post, you
probably you loved the work of these guys (and girls) back in the day.
I strongly recommend giving some of their newer stuff a listen.  If
you’re pleasantly surprised, keep an eye out for an upcoming post about
newer bands that emulate this style even though it guarantees they’ll
never get rich or even played on the radio. Hint: it’s now called
SynthPop–maybe the world’s dorkiest musical genre.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I saw
<a href="http://louisville.edu/faculty/cjcour02">Charles Courtemanche</a> present
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17483">an interesting paper</a> about how
people react to changes in food prices. Turns out the impatient people
and those who might have trouble with commitment (to diets for example)
are quicker to buy more food when the prices drop.  The paper had some
issues so I wouldn’t immediately go betting the farm on the results, but
it used some measures of how people think about time that got me thinking.</p>

<p>The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 cohort) interviewed
individuals age 14-22 in 1979 and continued to interview them every year
until 1994 and every two years after that.  It includes great data on
schooling, employment, income, fertility, marriage, and cognitive
skills.  In 2006, they added two particularly interesting questions.
First, they asked about trade-offs between getting money today versus one
year later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you have won a prize of $1000, which you can claim
immediately. How- ever, you have the alternative of waiting one year
to claim the prize. If you do wait, you will receive more than
$1000. What is the smallest amount of money in addition to the $1000
you would have to receive one year from now to convince you to wait
rather than claim the prize now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this question, it’s easy to compute an annual discount rate;
i.e., how much an individual values the present over the past.  If
someone says they would be indifferent between $1000 today and $1100 a
year from now, then their discount rate would be 1100/1000, or about
0.91.  That is, a dollar today is only worth 91 cents a year from now.</p>

<p>In Courtemanche’s paper, they report that the average discount factor of
respondents based on the first question is 0.59.  That is, on average,
people report indifference between $1000 today and $1684 a year from
now.  This is far far lower than any revealed preference measure I’ve
ever seen.  For example, in Keane and Wolpin’s classic 1997 paper, they
estimate that the discount factor is 0.9367, based on career choices of
young men in the same data set.  Rust and Phelan’s 1997 paper reports an
estimate of the discount factor of 0.98 based on retirement decisions of
low income older men in another data set.  And then there’s the fact
that if people really did discount the future at a really high rate, why
would they ever invest their money in assets that return 5-10%?
Strange.</p>

<p>It turns out people sometimes report different annual discount rates
depending on how long they have to wait–that is, they are inconsistent
about how much they discount the future.  You can get at the extent of
this inconsistency by looking at answers to a second (very similar)
question that was added to the NLSY in 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you have won a prize of $1000, which you can claim
immediately. How- ever, you can choose to wait <strong>one month</strong> to claim the
prize. If you do wait, you will receive more than $1000. What is the
smallest amount of money in addition to the $1000 you would have to
receive one month from now to convince you to wait rather than claim
the prize now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could compute an annual discount rate from this question too, and
for many (most?) people it will be lower, because we think that people
are “present-biased.”  That is, as soon as they have to wait at all,
there is a penalty.  The average discount rate in the data based on this
question is indeed lower: 0.28.  Quasi-hyperbolic discounting formalizes the
idea of present bias by saying that individuals discount future payments
that are t periods away by β δ<sup>t</sup> where β is
the measure of present bias and δ is the “pure” measure of time
preference.  </p>

<p>The average estimates reported in the Courtemanche paper are 0.80 for
β and 0.75 for δ.  I don’t have much intuition for what these
numbers should be, but Fang and Sliverman’s 2009 paper (published in
International Economic Review) uses the NLSY 1979 to estimate them based
on labor supply and welfare take-up decisions of single mothers.  They
get a very different number for β (0.34) and a kind of close one
for δ (0.88).  You can look at the glass as half-empty or
half-full.</p>

<p>Personally, I find this inconsistency in estimates of people’s time
inconsistency somewhat disturbing.  It makes me wonder what would happen
if the NLSY added a third question where the time people had to wait was
even shorter.  Like a day instead of month.  This would give us another
estimate of β.  If it was very close to 0.28, I’d feel better about
the theory of hyperbolic discounting.  Perhaps these experiments have
already been done in the lab?  We’ve now reached the limits of my
knowledge of this area.</p>
