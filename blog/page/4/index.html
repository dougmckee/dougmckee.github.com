<p>I recently made a quick return visit to Philadelphia and rediscovered one of my favorite Philly institutions. It wasn&rsquo;t the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_bell">Liberty Bell</a>, the <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/music-art/philadelphia/love-statue/">Love sculpture</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/06/tetris-skyscraper_n_5099208.html">giant tetris tower</a>. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawa,_Inc.">Wawa</a>: the world&rsquo;s greatest convenience store. What makes it so much better than 7-Eleven, ampm, or even the recently departed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Hen">White Hen</a>? Two things:</p>

<p>Every new programming project involves choosing a language early in the process. This choice can be exciting and daunting at the same time, as it always involves weighing several conflicting factors. Based on many years of varied programming experience, here is my advice:</p>

<p>I grew up outside Boston surrounded by Irish-American kids named Sully and Patrick. Even though my last name was McKee, I was different. I was told that my ancestors were MacKays from Scotland who migrated to Ireland and changed their name to McKee to avoid discrimination. I read Scottish folk tales, fantasized about competing in the Highland Games, and seriously considered getting a kilt. I tracked down my tartan, and as a young adult toured Scottish castles and got lost in the moors on my mountain bike. I know this sounds ridiculous coming from a suburban American kid, but Scotland felt like home.

<p>Late at night, as I putter around the house folding laundry or washing dishes or putting away toys, I often listen to podcasts. Most are mainstream. For sports, I listen to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2864045">BS Report</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/grantland-nfl-podcast/id730254718?mt=2">Grantland NFL</a>; for tech stuff, I listen to <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>; and for real life, I like <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a> and <a href="http://dadsbeingdads.net">Dads Being Dads</a>.</p>

<p>My current favorite podcast, however, is not mainstream. The <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/">Requiem Metal Podcast</a> features two guys (Mark Rudolph and Jason Hundey) playing and talking about their favorite extreme metal. They started broadcasting in 2008 and have since produced 170 episodes. Every one stands on its own and I’ve had great fun digging into their back catalog to learn more about bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_(band)">Emperor</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_thrower">Bolt Thrower</a>.</p>

<p>In their lead up to episode 100, they profiled what they considered the 10 most “crucial” years in metal. These are years that had not just great album releases, but albums that had a big impact on the future of the whole heavy metal genre. Even though Mark and Jason were little kids in the 80’s, they definitely appreciate them in hindsight, and their top 10 includes 4 years from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_Decadence_81-91">decade</a>: 1984 (#5), 1985 (#10), 1988 (#9), and 1989 (#1).</p>

<p>I attended high school from 1982 to 1986 and listened to a tremendous amount of metal during that time. I started with hard rock, moved into glam/hair, expanded into classic metal, and loved exploring thrash and the beginnings of extreme metal. My friend Mike and I used to hang out at our local independent record store (Rockin’ Mania) and flip through whatever new (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal">Nü</a>) metal came in each week. If the cover looked interesting one of us (usually Mike) would buy it. That’s how we discovered Metallica’s <em>Ride the Lightning</em>, Mercyful Fate’s <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, and the amazing Best of Metal Blade compilation albums.</p>

<p>I know I’m biased because 1983 was a particularly crucial year in metal for me, but three very important albums in the history of metal did come out that year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Kill em all</em> (Metallica). This was the first album by the biggest metal band of all time. It’s not as good as their next two, but it’s one of the first pure thrash records and it rocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Shout at the Devil</em> (Motley Crüe) I still remember seeing the album cover in a mall with my mom and being simultaneously scared, repulsed and intrigued. The <a href="http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/motleycrue/shoutatthedevil.html#1">first song on the album</a> is a weird Satanic-ish sermon (that I can still quote verbatim) and the music is surprisingly heavy for people who think of the Crüe as that band who sang “Girls Girls Girls” and “Home Sweet Home”. For tons of kids like me, this album was a powerful gateway into the world of real metal. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Melissa</em> (Mercyful Fate) Many people have written about how influential this band was on the development of the black metal genre, and extreme metal in general, but on the podcast, Mark often disparages Mercyful Fate by calling them “goofy” or “circus metal”. I’m here to tell you it didn’t come off that way <strong>at all</strong> back in the day. When my friend Mike bought their second album (<em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>) on a whim, we were completely creeped out the first time he played it. We just didn’t know what to do with the blasphemous lyrics, shreiking vocals, and unbelievably catchy guitar work. I had a copy on cassette which I ended up listening to a few times and then throwing in the trash. Mike did the same thing with his album–it’s like we thought we were destined to burn in hell if we kept them. Now, a little older and wiser we can appreciate the music and laugh at the lyrics. <em>Melissa</em>, their first album, isn’t as good as <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, but you can’t have a second without a first.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After high school, I moved away from home and away from metal. When hair metal disappeared from the radio, I thought metal itself  had died. In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s I knew Nü Metal was a thing, but only dabbled a bit with bands like Korn, Disturbed, and even Linkin Park. Later in the 2000’s I learned that music called black metal and death metal existed, but extreme metal can be an acquired taste and I just wasn’t ready. Now, with Mark and Jason’s help, I’m really enjoying filling in the huge gaps in my metal education.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Black metal is nasty stuff. Most of it revolves around Satanic imagery, shreiking vocals and guitars, incredibly fast “blast beat” drums, and spooky low fi production. Most bands hail from Scandinavia, and in the mid 90’s the nastiness reached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Satanic-Underground-Edition/dp/0922915946">particularly nasty level</a> as bands competed with each other to see who was the most evil by burning churches and murdering each other. And yet, I really appreciate the dark moodiness and musicality.</p>

<p>You can imagine my surprise when I found an honest-to-goodness Norwegian black metal band that is perfect for kids and adults. Now, whenever we get in the car, my two year old requests their music and proceeds to laugh and sing along! How did this happen? A confluence of two amazing things.</p>

<p>As I’ve already reported, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library/">my girls love the Rainbow Magic books</a>. While the heros are Kirsty, Rachel, and the fairies, the villains are Jack Frost and the goblins. Their home is an icy castle north of Fairy Land and they are frankly hilarious. The goblins call each other names, trip over each other, and are some of the least scary “monsters” you’ll ever meet. I remember in one book Rachel and Kirsty got their way by tickling the goblins.</p>

<p>The band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a> has been recording black metal since before their first full-length release: <em>Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism</em> in 1992. Their music is classic black metal, but many of their songs simply describe frigid mountains and the grumpy king who reigns over them. B’s favorite song is “Mountains of Might.” It starts with organ which B says is “carousel music” and contains vocals which she calls “a goblin talking:”</p>

<pre><code>The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
The winds are everblowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descend of the valley
Into the high impassable drifts
So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Forever standing here
These mountains northern face
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Icicled peeks as far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
</code></pre>

<p>The acoustic break in the middle is when “the goblins are dancing.” The whole album (<em>Blizzard Beasts</em>) is recorded with the vocals mixed extra loud so they don’t get lost. My favorite part is how Abbath (the lead singer) pronounces glaciers as “glaysseers”. The <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/antarctica-lyrics-immortal.html">lyrics of “Antarctica”</a> (from <em>Sons of Northern Darkness</em>) are similarly child-friendly and the music is similarly goblin-friendly.</p>

<p>The only downside to Immortal for kids is common to all heavy metal: the terribly inappropriate music videos. Immortal follows black metal tradition and performs in corpse paint while making lots of scary faces. They also seem to love weird spiked bondage gear. They look ridiculous and I try to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VBdAY8eA9w">their videos</a> too. It doesn’t have to be this way. Consider the video below to be my small contribution to making the world a better place:</p>

<p>Spring has finally arrived in Connecticut. The snow is gone, replaced by snowdrops and crocuses, and the birds have returned. We&rsquo;ve had great fun watching robins, bluejays, and red-winged blackbirds pulling on worms and building nests, and hearing their songs fill the air. </p>

<p>On the way home from school the other day we got an extra-special treat. As we drove by the reservoir, two hawks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> flew over the car fighting over something. The birds were big and their prey was big too. The hawks dipped and dove and then lost control of their prize, letting it fall right into the street in front of us. </p>

<p>When it bounced and rolled to a stop we saw it was a huge fish!  The whole rest of our trip home we wondered if the fish would still be there the next day and since it was a pretty busy street, hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t see a road-killed hawk (or two) lying near by.</p>

<p>The next morning we were never so happy to see a dead fish all alone by the side of the road. We had to pull over so everyone could get out to take a closer look. Whoever said bird watching was boring?</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Maybe they were ospreys, but we get a lot of red-tailed hawks around here and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk#Diet">Wikipedia</a> says they do occasionally eat fish.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
