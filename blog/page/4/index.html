  <div class="entry-content"><p>My three-year old daughter (R) is afraid of a variety of unusual things
(like vacuum cleaners, our old housekeeper, Mango the stuffed monkey,
and toy drills) and a few usual things (like the doctor) but for the
most part she’s pretty brave.  She loves all animals and creepy
crawlies, and neither the dark nor heights phase her.  Halloween is her
favorite holiday and she still likes when we joke about all the
vampires, mummies, and witches that live in the cemetary we drive by on
our way to school.  And some of her favorite books are about monsters.
Most of these books seem to be written to help kids get over fears of
monsters, but R just thinks they are hilarious.  We recently came back
from the library with a whole stack of monster books and it got me
thinking about our all-time favorites.</p>

Mercer Mayer wrote this long before he achieved fame and fortune with
his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Baby-Mercer-Mayer/dp/0307119424">Critter</a>
books and it has a little bit of an edge. Like many other books on
this list, it starts with a kid afraid of monsters and ends with the
monster being pretty nice.  In the middle, the kid fires his gun at the
monster.  The monster cries, the kid feels bad, and next thing you know
they are cuddled up in bed together.</p>

A puppy named Petra is scared of a monster that roams the house at night
and neither her parents nor her three siblings can help her feel safe.
But then they make a bunch of cookies and have a big party!  A good time
is had by all (including the monster) until mom and dad show up and send
them back to bed.  My daughter has this book at school and was so
excited when she found it at the library.  Our own copy from Amazon is
on its way now.</p>

The old song “Over in the Meadow” has been remade to death by children’s

haven’t turned R into a biter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goblin-Empty-Chair-Mem-Fox/dp/B003IWYJHM">The Goblin and the Empty Chair</a>:
Lots of kids books have two sets of jokes: one for the kids and one for
the grown-ups that are along for the ride.  This book has two stories.
My daughter thinks it’s about a goblin who thinks he is ugly, helps
some people, and then joins them for dinner.  She has no idea that the
family that the goblin helps is mourning the death of their son.  Seriously, this is
the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081283/">Ordinary People</a> picture
book.  It sounds crazy, but it works.  And the art is awesome.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birthday-Monsters-Boynton-Board-Sandra/dp/1563054434">Birthday Monsters!</a>:
This board book is geared toward a younger audience, but I still laugh
when I see the monsters raid the fridge during a game of hide-and-seek.
Sandra Boynton has so many good books, but this might be my favorite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Believe it or not, new wave isn’t dead.  It may not be popular anymore,
but several bands that haven’t had a hit in the US since the eighties
are still producing great music.  And I mean <strong>new</strong> music—they aren’t
just not milking their catalog for “new” remixes and playing the state
fair circuit in the summer.</p>

<p>While not all this new music is any good, you will be happy to know that
I’ve done the hard work of listening to it over the last couple weeks to
separate the wheat from the crap.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_League">The Human League</a> are
(is?) absolutely the most under-rated new wave band of the eighties.
About ten years ago I saw an eighties triple bill headlined by Boy
George. He was good, but the Human League were totally unexpectedly
fantastic. They nailed their old stuff (like (I’m Only) “Human”,
“Fascination”, and “Don’t You Want Me”) and their then new stuff (from
<em>Secrets</em> 2001) was just as good. It totally holds up today and I even
love their 2011 album <em>Credo</em>. Except for the more contemporary dance
beat on the lead track (Never Let Me Go) it could have been released in
1983.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys">The Pet Shop Boys</a>
disappeared from the US music scene at the end of the eighties, but,
just like Kylie Minogue, they have continued putting out hit album after
hit album in the UK.  They’re still sensitive and synthy but their music has
matured with them in a really good way.  My favorite of their recent
work is <em>Release</em> (2002), but the dance remixes of <em>Fundamental</em> (2006)
are a lot of fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey">Morrissey:</a> I loved the Smiths
and would have cried when they broke up if I hadn’t discovered them long
after the break-up had already happened.  Morrissey has amazingly just
continued to put out solid albums in the years since and thoroughly
proven that he was the talented one and that Johnny Marr (like Wham’s
Andrew Ridgely) was just along for the ride.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode">Depeche Mode</a> I’ll be
honest–I’m not one of those totally nutty Depeche Mode fans who believe
Dave Gahan is God.  And I left them behind after <em>Violator</em> (1989) even
though “Policy of Truth” is one of my all time favorite songs.  But they
do continue to produce music and I did take a chance on <em>Playing the
Angel</em> (2005).  It has one good track (“Precious”) and the rest is
crap.  Am I still bitter about that?  Yes.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure">The Cure</a> The Cure are an
amazing band and certainly Robert Smith is closer to God than Dave
Gahan.  Their range, from minimalist early new wave to syrupy pop to
wall of sound, is impressive.  When I saw them in 2003, I was blown away
by Smith’s guitar playing of all things.  That said, I’m not a huge fan
of their recent stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears">Tears for Fears</a> Their
first two albums (<em>The Hurting</em> and <em>Songs from the Big Chair</em>) hold up
surprisingly well, but <em>Seeds of Love</em> was a little goofy even for me.
They broke up in 1991 and Roland Orzabal released two kind of lousy
albums still using the band’s name.  They got back together and released
<em>Everyone Loves a Happy Ending</em> in 2004 and I’ve tried to like it over
the past few days.  It sounds just like <em>Seeds of Love</em> and I’ll let you
decide if that’s good or bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Jones_(musician)">Howard Jones</a>
opened the same triple bill I mentioned above and I had such high hopes
since I absolutely played <em>Dream Into Action</em> into the ground when I was
in high school.  Shoot, I still listen to it all the time!
Unfortunately, the show was a big let down and everything he’s recorded
since <em>In the Running</em> (1992) is in my opinion unlistenable.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ha">A-ha!</a> Most American’s think of A-ha
as that one-hit wonder with the fun cartoony music video, but they
happen to be the biggest band ever out of Norway and just broke up in
2010.  It’s kind of hard to find their albums (read: they aren’t in the
iTunes Store), but they do have a greatest hits (<em>The Singles:
1984-2004)</em>) that I’ve been enjoying.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaville_(band)">Alphaville</a> Released in
1984, “Big in Japan” and “Forever Young” are absolutely quintessential
eighties new wave songs.  I have a soft spot for their second (less
successful) album, <em>Afternoons in Utopia</em> (1986) since I wore out the
the cassette I copied from my freshman dorm roommate.  But I just can’t
listen to anything they’ve released since.  And I’ve tried.</p>

<p>If you’ve managed to read to the bottom of this too-long post, you
probably you loved the work of these guys (and girls) back in the day.
I strongly recommend giving some of their newer stuff a listen.  If
you’re pleasantly surprised, keep an eye out for an upcoming post about
newer bands that emulate this style even though it guarantees they’ll
never get rich or even played on the radio. Hint: it’s now called
SynthPop–maybe the world’s dorkiest musical genre.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I saw
<a href="http://louisville.edu/faculty/cjcour02">Charles Courtemanche</a> present
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17483">an interesting paper</a> about how
people react to changes in food prices. Turns out the impatient people
and those who might have trouble with commitment (to diets for example)
are quicker to buy more food when the prices drop.  The paper had some
issues so I wouldn’t immediately go betting the farm on the results, but
it used some measures of how people think about time that got me thinking.</p>

<p>The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 cohort) interviewed
individuals age 14-22 in 1979 and continued to interview them every year
until 1994 and every two years after that.  It includes great data on
schooling, employment, income, fertility, marriage, and cognitive
skills.  In 2006, they added two particularly interesting questions.
First, they asked about trade-offs between getting money today versus one
year later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you have won a prize of $1000, which you can claim
immediately. How- ever, you have the alternative of waiting one year
to claim the prize. If you do wait, you will receive more than
$1000. What is the smallest amount of money in addition to the $1000
you would have to receive one year from now to convince you to wait
rather than claim the prize now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this question, it’s easy to compute an annual discount rate;
i.e., how much an individual values the present over the past.  If
someone says they would be indifferent between $1000 today and $1100 a
year from now, then their discount rate would be 1100/1000, or about
0.91.  That is, a dollar today is only worth 91 cents a year from now.</p>

<p>In Courtemanche’s paper, they report that the average discount factor of
respondents based on the first question is 0.59.  That is, on average,
people report indifference between $1000 today and $1684 a year from
now.  This is far far lower than any revealed preference measure I’ve
ever seen.  For example, in Keane and Wolpin’s classic 1997 paper, they
estimate that the discount factor is 0.9367, based on career choices of
young men in the same data set.  Rust and Phelan’s 1997 paper reports an
estimate of the discount factor of 0.98 based on retirement decisions of
low income older men in another data set.  And then there’s the fact
that if people really did discount the future at a really high rate, why
would they ever invest their money in assets that return 5-10%?
Strange.</p>

<p>It turns out people sometimes report different annual discount rates
depending on how long they have to wait–that is, they are inconsistent
about how much they discount the future.  You can get at the extent of
this inconsistency by looking at answers to a second (very similar)
question that was added to the NLSY in 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you have won a prize of $1000, which you can claim
immediately. How- ever, you can choose to wait <strong>one month</strong> to claim the
prize. If you do wait, you will receive more than $1000. What is the
smallest amount of money in addition to the $1000 you would have to
receive one month from now to convince you to wait rather than claim
the prize now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could compute an annual discount rate from this question too, and
for many (most?) people it will be lower, because we think that people
are “present-biased.”  That is, as soon as they have to wait at all,
there is a penalty.  The average discount rate in the data based on this
question is indeed lower: 0.28.  Quasi-hyperbolic discounting formalizes the
idea of present bias by saying that individuals discount future payments
that are t periods away by β δ<sup>t</sup> where β is
the measure of present bias and δ is the “pure” measure of time
preference.  </p>

<p>The average estimates reported in the Courtemanche paper are 0.80 for
β and 0.75 for δ.  I don’t have much intuition for what these
numbers should be, but Fang and Sliverman’s 2009 paper (published in
International Economic Review) uses the NLSY 1979 to estimate them based
on labor supply and welfare take-up decisions of single mothers.  They
get a very different number for β (0.34) and a kind of close one
for δ (0.88).  You can look at the glass as half-empty or
half-full.</p>

<p>Personally, I find this inconsistency in estimates of people’s time
inconsistency somewhat disturbing.  It makes me wonder what would happen
if the NLSY added a third question where the time people had to wait was
even shorter.  Like a day instead of month.  This would give us another
estimate of β.  If it was very close to 0.28, I’d feel better about
the theory of hyperbolic discounting.  Perhaps these experiments have
already been done in the lab?  We’ve now reached the limits of my
knowledge of this area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my house we read a lot of books to our kids.  We read after school,
on weekends, while traveling, during meals and (of course) right before
bed.  I was a voracious reader as a kid and I hope to impart this habit
and pure love of reading to my kids.  There’s something about reading a
book and visualizing the scenes and action in your mind that expands
your imagination much more than watching a movie ever could.  Reading
with your kids is also a just high quality parent-child time.  You never
have to press pause to stop and talk about issues raised in the story.</p>

<p>We also run a fairly gadget-friendly household.  My wife and I often
work at our computers, we both have iPhones, and our iPad is pretty much
our living room computer.  My three-year old has almost as many apps as
I do.  You would think we would be actively transitioning all our
reading to e-books, but we’re not.</p>

<h3 id="the-good"><strong>The Good</strong></h3>

<p>E-books have a lot of advantages over physical books.  I love that you
can load up an iPad with a few hundred and it weighs no more than a
couple paperbacks.  While picture books look like junk (if they are
available at all) on the Kindle, they look fine on the iPad.  Some
e-books have a “read aloud” option and will repeat words and sentences
with a touch.  We don’t use these features much as a parent is usually the one
reading, but it’s nice to have the option.</p>

<p>Pricing of e-books is generally higher than the used physical book
price, but I think (hope?) it’s only a matter of time before that changes.
I especially hope that the publishers realize that parents would love to
buy “boxed sets” for a reasonable price.  If I could buy all 26 of the Curious
George books in the iBooks store for $52 (that’s $2 each) I’d jump on
it.  Instead, they charge between $3.99 and $8.99 each and I end up
spending a total of $3.99 on George.  We all lose out.</p>

<p>Availability is a similar story–it’s lousy now but I have high hopes it
will get better.  The great thing will be that once a book is in digital
format, there’s no reason it should ever go out of print.  So when I
want a mint condition copy of Amy Tan’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sagwa-Chinese-Siamese-Cat-Amy/dp/0689846177">Sagwa, The Chinese Siamese Cat</a>
I don’t have to wait a single minute.  And if libraries can get in on
the action, their catalogs will be amazing.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad"><strong>The Bad</strong></h3>

<p>As I’ve already mentioned, the current pricing and availability
situation is atrocious for kids’ books.  But these aren’t the only
problems.</p>

<p>My iPad has a 9.7 inch display.  The vast majority of the kids’ books in
our house are a lot bigger.  That means you either see a small version
of the page or you’re constantly panning and zooming.  Graeme Bass’
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Golden-Snail-Graeme-Base/dp/0810989654">Legend of the Golden Snail</a>
is 12 inches by 22 inches open.  That’s 25 inches diagonal
(according to Pythagoras) and it’s going to be a long time before tablet
displays get that big.  The resolution on a printed page is a lot better
than my iPad today, but that could presumably <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/12/ipad-3-to-pave-way-for-1080p-itunes-content-and-a-new-apple-tv/">change in the next month or so</a>.
And you can completely forget about duplicating the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394873742">Richard Scarry’s Biggest Word Book Ever!</a>
experience–it opens to 32 inches by 24 inches.</p>

<p>Even if I’m willing to give in on all this stuff for my three-year-old,
there’s no way an e-book works for a one-year-old.  We have close to 100
board books, touch and feel books, and cloth books that can withstand
constant mouthing and provide good tactile feedback.  </p>

<h3 id="the-worrying"><strong>The Worrying</strong></h3>

<p>I’m mostly optimistic about the future of e-books for kids, but there
is a trend that worries me.  The kids’ e-books that get the most praise
from critics and the highest ratings in the iOS app store tend to be the
flashiest and most movie-like.  Sesame Street’s
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monster-at-end-this-book...starring/id409467802">The Monster at the End of This Book</a>
is a perfect example.  It lasted about 5 minutes on my iPad before I saw
my daughter’s eyes glaze over and I deleted it.  The Critter books
(e.g.,
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/just-me-and-my-dad-for-ipad/id364723303">Just Me and My Dad</a>)
aren’t much better.  They at least let you read the story while you
click around the page trying to make animals do funny things.</p>

<p>It’s not that I think interactive features are a bad thing in e-books,
but I think they are a lot more appropriate in books for adults like
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847">The Elements: A Visual Exploration</a>
and Al Gore’s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id432753658">Our Choice</a>.
Even textbooks has a lot to gain from embedded movie clips, social
network integration, and dynamic graphs.  And I’m excited about the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a> software enabling a
whole new wave of these kinds of books.</p>

<p>But God help us if children’s book publishers suddenly think they have tart up old
content to get us to buy it electronically.  Let my daughters and I
imagine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curious-George-Rides-Bike-Rey/dp/0395174449">George riding his bike</a> in the circus without turning it into
mini-game.  Let us laugh about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">Franklin’s messy closet</a> without having to
interactively explore it.  And let us imagine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Book-Margaret-Brown/dp/0061119776">old lady whispering “hush”</a> without having to hear it out loud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m old. I grew up wandering around record stores trying to decide
whether to buy albums based on one or two songs I might have heard on
the radio, cover art, and what I knew about the band. These were big
decisions when I didn’t have much money and cd’s were $15-17 each.</p>

<p>Today’s online music world couldn’t be more different.  Kids these days
think about albums like they’re rotary dial phones–they download gobs of
music for free (e.g., BitTorrent) or they just listen to whatever they
want through Pandora or Spotify.  And when they do actually shell out cash,
it’s 99 cents per song.</p>

<p>But I live in the past and still agonize over album purchases.  Prices have
gone down and my income has gone up a little, but I like owning my
music legally and I still like listening to the set of songs an artist
chose to package together as an album.  Over time though, I’ve developed
a few rules to guide me in the decision process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Learn from previous purchases if the band produces albums with a few
good tracks and filler.  Madonna and Metallica both produce tremendous
quality throughout while Katy Perry is more up and down.  The younger
the artist, the more careful you have to be (Yes I’m looking at you
Justin Bieber!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Best of” albums can be a treasure trove (e.g., Electric Light
Orchestra or Heart) if original album quality is spotty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beware of bargains–it’s those dreaded filler albums that are
most often on sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can restrain yourself from the impulse purchase, listen to the
album a couple times through on Spotify first.  A minute and a half
sample often isn’t enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iTunes has deluxe versions of many albums that contain remixes and
the occasional music video.  With YouTube, the video’s not much of a
draw, but I never regret the remixes which are often better than the
original versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because it’s a concept album doesn’t you shouldn’t. cherry pick
the best tracks. Judas Priest’s <em>Nostradamus</em> just isn’t that good even
though the second track (“Prophecy”) rocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As bends enter the twilight of their careers, albums get worse and
worse even though they can still produce individually good
songs. Metallica and Depeche Mode are great examples. This is the bright
side of a great band breaking up mid-career like The Beatles, Led
Zeppelin, or The Smiths.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Bottom line: The album may be dying, but it’s not dead yet.  At least
not in my little fantasy world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Messenger bags have been getting a lot of flack on
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/backpacks-my-bff/">Ben Brooks’ blog</a>
lately as he has made the complete switch to a
<a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0103">Tom Bihn Smart Alec backpack</a>.
He raves about the ergonomics and pockets and even makes a case that it
looks kinda cool.  Maybe this set up works for him, but I’m very happy
with my decidedly non-hipster plain vanilla blue and black
<a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/classic-messenger/1809057">Timbuk2 Classic Messenger</a>.</p>

<p>It’s almost all one cavernous compartment which gives me maximum
flexibility.  It’s is perfect for any combination of books, folders,
iPads, or my MacBook Air in it’s Zero Shock sleeve.  I leave the sleeve
unzipped so it’s easy to take the MBA in and out and if I don’t need it,
the whole sleeve/MBA combo stays home.  I love the simplicity of never
having to remember what’s in what pocket.  I’ve even used it to
transport pretty big boxes– they can stick out if need be and the flap
can partially cover them but be secured by the strap.</p>

<p>It’s super-fast to open and close since I don’t have to take it off my
back or loosen any straps.  I can keep my bike lock there when I’m out
and about and it’s trivial to pull it out and put it back in as needed.</p>

<p>It’s perfect for cycling–the weight is on your hips instead of your
back/shoulders and that makes for much better stability.  Just make sure
you use the strap that attaches to a belt loop so it doesn’t swing
around unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The ballistic nylon show almost no wear.  My bag is six years old and
I’ve put it through the laundry maybe three times.  And it’s not like I’ve
babied it–it’s with me outdoors every day rain, shine, or even the
arctic conditions of last winter in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The bottom line: Six years from now I’ll probably be using exactly the
same bag.  And it’ll still look great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have noticed that I hardly ever write posts that just link to
something good I’ve read elsewhere on the web.  That’s what most people
use Tumblr for, but my main goal here is to write and share original
content.  It doesn’t mean I don’t run across things I find interesting
and want to share through other channels.  I also like to save good
stuff in the cloud where I can easily access and search it.  I hate
remembering I saw something and then not being able to find it again
later.  These two related goals (sharing and archival) have led me to a
somewhat unique system that I think satisfies both pretty well.</p>

<p>I do most of my reading of web content in a browser, an RSS reader
(Reeder), or Instapaper, and want to be able to share and archive easily
in all three.  If all I wanted to do was share, I’d probably hold my
nose and just tweet everything.  Twitter is well-integrated into all
three apps and my friends could just follow me or visit the Twitter
website as needed.  But I want to be able to archive <strong>and</strong> share in a
single step.</p>

<p><a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> is an <em>almost</em> free service that stores bookmarks and lets you
search them by tags you assign.  I pay a little extra ($25/yr) and they
save the full text of the pages and let me search that too.  They
provide a bookmarklet that lets me tag pages from almost any web browser
and the same functionality is built into my RSS reader.  If I think my
friends might also find a page interesting, I just add a “like” tag.</p>

<p><a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> is a service that saves content that
I find on the web but don’t have time to read in the moment.  When it’s
more convenient, I bring up the Instapaper app on my iPhone or iPad and
it’s turned all my saved pages into beautifully formatted highly
readable ad-free text.  If I like what I read there, I just mark it that
way by clicking on the heart icon.  I have my account configured to then
automatically send the link to Pinboard for archival.</p>

<p>There are several ways for you to see what I’ve found interesting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Follow me on pinboard; my username is dmckee.  You’ll see everything I
tag, including stuff I’m archiving but not necessarily recommending.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visit my pinboard pages:</p>

    <p>What I like: <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/t:like">https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/t:like</a></p>

    <p>What got sent over from Instapaper: <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/from:instapaper">https://pinboard.in/u:dmckee/from:instapaper</a></p>

    <p>I wish these could be combined in a single page.  If Instapaper would
  tag items I like with “like” when it sends them to Pinboard, you would
  only have to visit the first one.  My system is good, but it’s not perfect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subscribe to my Pinboard RSS feeds:</p>

    <p><a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/t:like">http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/t:like</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/from:instapaper">http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dmckee/from:instapaper</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow me on Instapaper (dmckee@ucla.edu).  You only get a subset of
the stuff I’m sharing, but it’s a good subset.  I wish things I share
directly through Pinboard would automatically get liked and archived in
Instapaper so this would be complete.  But not even
<a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt.com</a> can take care of this.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A few of the blogs I read publish an about-weekly list of their very
favorite recent links.  Maybe I’ll do that someday, but for now we’re
going with this.</p>

  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down again.
  All men play on ten,
  Never gonna turn down.
 
           "All Men Play on 10" 
           <em>Manowar, Sign of the Hammer</em>, 1984
</pre>

<p>Songs that celebrate rock and roll are a dime a dozen.  I mean, I love
Joan Jett’s “I Love Rock and Roll” and Ozzy Osbourne’s “You Can’t Kill
Rock and Roll” and even Huey Lewis’ “Heart of Rock and
Roll” as much as anyone, but the idea is a little played out.</p>

<p>On the other hand, songs that literally <strong>demand</strong> to be played loud and
explicitly proclaim the band’s love of loud music are tremendously
under-appreciated.  It’s a much smaller genre, but I can (and do) listen
to these songs over and over.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of my favorites (<a href="http://c.itunes.apple.com/us/imix/play-it-loud!/id497298702">Ping version</a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>“All Men Play on 10” <em>Manowar</em></li>
  <li>“Turn Up the Radio” <em>Autograph</em></li>
  <li>“I Love It Loud” <em>Kiss</em></li>
  <li>“Shout It Out Loud” <em>Kiss</em></li>
  <li>“Louder than Hell” <em>Motley Crue</em></li>
  <li>“We Like It Loud” <em>Rough Cutt</em></li>
  <li>“Turn It Up” <em>Ted Nugent</em></li>
  <li>“The Right to Rock” <em>Keel</em></li>
  <li>“I Wanna Rock” <em>Twisted Sister</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The first track, “All Men Play on 10” by Manowar is not the most
popular, but definitely has the most testosterone.  Everyone has
probably heard “Turn Up the Radio” by Autograph as it got tons of
airplay during the eighties, but Kiss has to be the undisputed king of
the category with two contributions: “I Love It Loud” and “Shout it Out
Loud”.  “Louder than Hell” from Motley Crue wasn’t one of their hits,
but it’s always been one of my favorites.  Rough Cutt’s “We Like it
Loud” and Ted Nugent’s “Turn It Up” are more obscure, but still
classics.</p>

<p>The last two songs on my list are honorable mentions because they’re
really more straight up rock anthems than only tangentially suggest that
music shouldn’t be turned down.  Keel’s “The Right to Rock” says</p>

<pre>
  Don't let anyone tell you
  How to live your life
  We won't turn it off
  We won't turn it down
  'Cause it's our way of life
</pre>

<p>while Twisted Sister’s “I Wanna Rock” says:</p>

<pre>
  Turn it down you say,
  Well all i got to say to you is 
  Time and time again i say, "no!"
  No! no, no, no, no, no!
</pre>

<p>I’m absolutely certain I’ve left out some important tracks.  So any
suggested additions will be much appreciated!</p>

<h2 id="update">Update:</h2>

<p>I asked for help on
<a href="http://www.classicrockforums.com/forum/f7/play-loud-19367/">Classic Rock Forums</a> and got some
great suggested additions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Loud” <em>Sammy Hagar</em></li>
  <li>“Shout” <em>Grand Prix</em></li>
  <li>“Blow Your Speakers” <em>Manowar</em></li>
  <li>“Loud and Clear” <em>Autograph</em></li>
  <li>“Play It Loud” <em>Diamond Head</em></li>
  <li>“Play It Loud” <em>Saxon</em></li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t believe I forgot to include “Blow Your Speakers”, but the other five tracks
are new to me.  Every one is worth a listen–cranked up all the way of
course!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend Julian is a pretty nice guy.  He’s generous with his time and
tolerant of most social behavior.  He honors his commitments and is
honest in his communication.  But at the same time, he chooses not to
participate in the US democratic government by voting.  For those of us
who see voting as a moral obligation, this is somewhat disturbing.
Julian recently posted a
<a href="http://tunesforbears.com/2012/01/19/no-really-i-dont-vote/">clear statement of why</a>
on <a href="http://tunesforbears.com">his blog</a> (which makes for a good read in general
BTW).  Since he is economic theorist by training, he makes his argument
by laying out a fairly standard economic model of voting and pointing
out how it is perfectly rational for him to vote and many other people
not to.</p>

<p>In Julian’s model, people benefit from voting in two ways: the (slight)
chance they will personally influence the election and the “warm glow”
(WG) they get from the experience.  If the sum of these outweigh the
costs of missing work and traveling to the polling place, then people
will vote.  Julian justifies his personal decision by saying that most
other people must get a warmer feeling inside when they vote since the
chance of any one person changing the election is tiny.  As
models go, this one is pretty empty (as Julian admits) since so much of
the action happens in WG and it says nothing about where WG comes from.</p>

<p>I think utilitarian models are great for describing behavior, but lousy
for defining what behavior is right or wrong.  Just because someone
might find stealing to be individually rational if their chances of
being caught are low, that doesn’t make it right.  Before I go on, I
want to be perfectly clear that I don’t know anything about
philosophy–I couldn’t even make much sense of this
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Beginners-Writers-Readers-Documentary/dp/086316157X">comic book guide to philosphy</a>
when I read it a few years ago.  That said, Julian’s description of
Kant’s categorical imperative really spoke to me.  In his (Julian’s)
words, “citizens are morally obligated to vote if they prefer a world in
which others do”.  I translate this to mean “it’s immoral to free-ride
on other people’s voting behavior”.  This is a statement <em>outside</em> the
model about behavior that may or may not be rational <em>inside</em> the model.
Julian justifies his own action in this context by saying he wants
everyone to act as he would act <em>conditional on the WG they happen to
feel</em>.</p>

<p>If Kant were here, I think he would say that WG is BS and that people
don’t decide whether or not to vote in order to maximize their
utility–they decide between right and wrong.  I vote because I want
to live in a world where everyone (or at least the informed folks vote),
not because it makes me feel warmer than it does Julian.  To be more
precise, I think WG is almost homogeneously distributed and some people
are moral and some are immoral free-riders.</p>

<p>Of course, my statement about Julian being an upstanding moral guy in
the rest of his life still holds.  :) I just think he’s putting too much
faith in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics">the first theorem of welfare economics</a>.
Just because there are some (many?) situations where individually
rational behavior leads to a socially optimal outcome doesn’t mean all
situations are like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jacob Mincer’s 1958 paper in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>,
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1827422">“Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution”</a>,
is one of the most well-cited in economics–304 times according to
<a href="http://apps.isiknowledge.com">Web of Science</a>.  And yet, I would be
shocked if more than half the people who’ve cited the paper have even
opened it and read the first page.  The reason it’s cited so often is that Mincer
did indeed write down the famed Mincer equation here, but he
wasn’t the first to notice that log wages are an approximately linear
function of years of education.  What’s special about this paper is that
Mincer was the first person to write down a simple utility-maximizing
model from which you can derive such an equation.</p>

<p>Wages are not normally distributed.  The lower half of the distribution
is all clustered together, but the high end is really spread out.  And
all those
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street">one percenters</a> at the
high end are making far more than average wages.  But physical
dimensions like height, head circumference, and forearm length <em>are</em>
normally distributed.  And though it’s a lot harder to measure, most
scholars believe that cognitive ability is normally distributed too. In
the early part of the twentieth century, this was seen as something of a
paradox–if physical and cognitive ability are the major determinants of
productivity then shouldn’t wages (which measure productivity) also be
normally distributed? </p>

<p>The average gain in wages that comes from an additional year of schooling
increases with the amount of schooling someone has.  Expected wages go
up by more for the 16th year of schooling than the 12th year of
schooling.  One of Mincer’s insights was that a big part of the
non-normality of the wage distribution is a direct consequence of these
non-linear returns to schooling.</p>

<p>Mincer had great intuition.  He recognized that a person must eventually
be compensated for wages they could have earned during the years they
attend school.  The more schooling you already have, the more you need
to be compensated for getting an additional year of schooling.  Mincer
shows that in his model, wages must increase multiplicatively for each
year and that is exactly what happens when the log wage is a linear
function of years of education.  In the data, wages are generally
associated with about a 15 <em>percent</em> increase for each year of
schooling.</p>

<p>Academic economists worship at the altar of the new and technically
sophisticated.  This means the vast majority of econ papers written
before the 1980’s just languish on library shelves.  And even though
it’s true that most of these older papers aren’t terribly relevant, I
think Mincer (1958) is just one of several diamonds in the rough.  I’m
always on the look out for more, and would welcome any suggestions.</p>
