  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first time I saw the World Wide Web, I was hunched over an 8 lb laptop using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">text based browser</a> and a 56k modem. There wasn’t much to see and it didn’t seem like a big deal. Then about three month’s later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a> (the first graphical browser) was released and I “got it.” Within a week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaviSoft">we</a> redefined our product line and turned a generic set of “network publishing” tools into a web server and a web authoring tool.  Within a year we were purchased by America Online to show that they “got” the web too. My point is that I’ve been deeply embedded in the web for a long time.  </p>

<p>And yet, not including my professional <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dm529">web-based resume/cv</a>, I didn’t have my own website until exactly a year ago when High Variance was <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/14573237390/first-post">born</a>. I’m not sure why it took me so long to get here, but after a year of any project, I think it’s important to step back and take stock to see if the original goals are being met. I had three:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create more:</strong>  As expected, the topics have been eclectic ranging from economic policy to kid book reviews to eighties pop music.  The rate of production has been similarly irregular with a burst of activity last January (17 posts) and a summer hiatus.  But the aggregate rate has been about one post per week.  I’m happy with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learn to write better and more comfortably:</strong> Perhaps my biggest surprise is how enjoyable the whole process has been. I don’t get anxious when I write here and my anxiety level when writing professionally has definitely decreased.  When my mind is spinning about a topic, writing about it actually gets me to calm down and figure out what I actually think about it.  As for the quality of the writing, I think I’m getting better, but it’s hard to tell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide entertaining, useful, and/or inspiring content:</strong> My audience will need to be the judge of this, but I know I’ve given at least a few chuckles, a few bits of helpful advice, and even tugged on a few heartstrings.  And in looking back on what I’ve written, much of the content seems to have aged well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose I should also say something about my readership. According to Google Analytics, over the past year I’ve have 2,070 unique visitors (5.7 per day) and 4,000 page views (11 per day). Not much, but if you squint at the chart, it does look like traffic is trending slightly up.  There are even a few posts that get regular search engine traffic–<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18591130112/why-are-zebras-so-mean-and-horses-so-nice">zebras</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/23166850855/pdf-annotation-on-the-ipad-in-2012">pdf annotation on the iPad</a>, and <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16047390011/mincer-1958">Mincer 1958</a> are the top three.</p>

<p>As I was about to blow out the candles on my birthday cake a few weeks ago I realized something very special: I didn’t have anything new to wish for.  I have a wonderful wife and two lovely children.  We’re all healthy and happy with our jobs and our house.  I just want what I already have.  That’s kind of true of this blog too.  So here’s to another fun and fulfilling year!</p>

<time datetime="2012-12-17T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 17<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about conflict and sharing lately. First because we watch this Sesame Street video almost every night with the girls:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl3e-OUnavQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In case you’re video-averse and don’t want to watch the whole hilarious two minutes and seven seconds, Robin Williams and the two-headed monster “introduce” children to the word <em>conflict</em>. I put “introduce” in quotes because this is a concept with which every child older than 6 months is already intimately familiar. Some kids might use different terms–“fighting!” is quite popular in our house–but the concept is clear. The video also shows the two-headed monster doing something that’s a little less natural for kids: sharing. </p>

<p>Second, my blog-friend<sup id="fnref:fn_blogfriend"><a href="#fn:fn_blogfriend" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Chris Blattman <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2012/12/13/where-property-rights-really-come-from/">wrote</a> recently about how they handle sharing at his daughter’s daycare. In a nutshell, they don’t push it and instead focus on developing a child’s sense of ownership.  The idea is that when kids realize that their stuff won’t be rudely ripped away when friends express interest, they will start sharing voluntarily. </p>

<p>but mostly interact with through their blog. It makes for awkward conversations as you always feel closer to them than they feel to you.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest reason I’ve been thinking about this subject is the conflict and relatively smaller amount of sharing that happens at home with the girls (4 yrs and ~18 months).  We have developed our own fairly complex tri-partite system of communal rights, partial rights, and exclusive rights.  Most of the toys are communal property–there is no “mine” for these. When one kid is playing with a toy in this category and the other kid wants in, we try to get them to say “Can I have a turn?” and then enforce a reasonably short time limit. </p>

<p>A smaller group of toys have owners (e.g., birthday presents) but still must be shared. These often come in groups (like fairies or ponies) where it’s fun to play with the whole group, but neither kid owns the whole group. Dividing ownership in this way provides incentives to play together–if you share your own stuff, you get access to your sibling’s stuff too. This arrangement is also designed to break down R’s hoarding tendencies.</p>

<p>The last category is the smallest: pure property rights.  R has a plush pony and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Toy-Amelia-Groovy-Girl/dp/B0077LGIEM">groovy girl</a> in this group and her sister has a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Monster-Plush-Bowling/dp/B000GL1DTA">6 small plush monsters</a>.  The girls are certainly allowed to share these (R rarely does) but sharing is never required. Occasionally one girl will pick up the other’s toy, but when owner notices and demands it back, it’s always given up immediately.</p>

<p>Our system isn’t perfect and may in fact be more complicated than the girls’ little brains can handle. My bet is that if we reduced the number of categories, we would also reduce the amount of conflict. But I’m not sure what category(ies) would go. I don’t want to assign an owner to every toy–that would be miserable to keep track of and wouldn’t promote a cooperative spirit.  I like that they maintain some ownership of presents that they’ve received individually.  And the most extreme group is where we see the least amount of conflict–the last thing I want is <em>more</em> fighting!  So we’re going to keep the system we’ve got and hope that the kids are learning about both property rights and cooperation.  Check back in twenty years to see if it worked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The eighties are not known as a time of soul bearing honesty (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">Iran-Contra</a>), but
eighties music is full of cheesy earnestness about love in its various
messy forms.  Eighties singers told the hard truths even when it made
them look weak.  Here are four great examples of eighties guys who
weren’t afraid to play the victim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abYzI9ycjk">Everything She Wants</a> (by
Wham, 1984): George Michael is having a rough time with a no-good
money-grubbing girlfriend.  I smile every time he finds out
she’s pregnant and says “If my best isn’t good enough, how can it be
good enough for two?  I can’t work any harder than I do!” Maybe this was
the incident that turned him off women forever?  Not that there’s
anything wrong with that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu788foYCa8">I’ve Done Everything For You</a>
(Rick Springfield, 1981): Based on my analysis of his catalog, this
guy seems like he was just a bad boyfriend.  He lusted after his friend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs">Jessie’s girl</a>.  He told his girl not to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp42V938eBA">talk to strangers</a>.  And here
he says “I’ve done everything for you; you’ve done nothing for me!”
At least he was <a href="http://ztams.com/index.php?action=display&amp;ref=26342">good looking</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0">Don’t You Want Me?</a>(by
The Human League, 1981) This is another case of a guy who did
everything–“I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around”
and she’s got the nerve to dump him.  What’s unique in this song is that she
gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZW1C3neao">The Rain</a> (by Oran Juice
Jones, 1986): Here’s where we see that eighties male victimhood
crossed race lines.  The best part of the song is when we listen in on Mr. Jones
confronting his cheating girlfriend and telling her “You gotta get on
outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, punch-bucket-shoe-wearing
crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2012-12-08T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 8<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc">MOOC</a> is an acroynm for Massive Open Online Course.  It’s a trendy name
for packing up a course’s content (video lectures, problem sets, exams,
a mechanism for peer interactions, etc.) and making it available to a large
number of students over the internet without requiring significant live instructor input.
It’s that last part that allows the system to scale and separates the
idea from simple distance learning or a traditional online course.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about MOOC’s is the expansion in availability of
university-level content.  At least three groups of top-tier
universities in the US (<a href="http://www.edx.org">edX</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.org">Udacity</a>) are
actively producing these kinds of online courses and making them
available for free to anyone.  It means that kids and
adults from rural China to urban Brazil can watch and learn from the
some of the best professors in the world and interact with each other
about the material.</p>

<p>A second exciting thing about MOOC’s is that they promise to be a major
disruptive innovation for existing institutions of higher education.
Think about what happens in an average traditional college course.  The
professor stands up and gives a lecture taking occasional questions from
the class. He/she assigns reading and homework and gives exams. They are
somewhat available to answer questions in office hours or by email. A
MOOC isn’t better on every dimension, but I believe they’ve recently crossed a
line and the overall experience is actually better than the average
college course.  </p>

<p>As students become aware of MOOC’s, I think a few will decide to forego
college and instead learn what they want to learn more cheaply and on
their own schedule.  Most students (and their future employers) however
will want a credential (degree) that “proves” they have mastered a set
of material.  It’s only a matter of time before the big three (or
someone new) comes along and is able to provide this.  Online degrees
exist today and I predict they will become more and more
mainstream.<sup id="fnref:fn_dating"><a href="#fn:fn_dating" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  That said, the current college experience is more than
courses and I think the market for that won’t be going away soon.  </p>

<p>Students will also start demanding more of classes at existing
universities and attending colleges that raise their game and start
providing higher quality in-class experiences.  That means colleges will
have to leverage what they have that the MOOC’s will never have: live
instructors/experts that are able to spend time either one-on-one or in
small groups with students answering questions and having real time
conversations. This is possible online, but it doesn’t scale up to
massive numbers of students per instructor.  Some faculty will start
building on MOOC content–that is, they will replace their own lectures
with those of the MOOC’s and add their own interactivity.  And I’m happy
to say that the he big live lecture will go the way of the horse and
buggy–average professors just won’t be able to compete with the top
professors in the world and their video lectures.</p>

<p>I was going to title this post “The Revolution’s Coming” but the
revolution is already here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like Paul Krugman a lot–we’re both liberals and believe strongly in
the value of big government and thougtful regulation.  Unfortunately, he
sometimes has strong opinions about things he hasn’t thought through.
That’s my only explanation for his <a href="">recent article</a> on the “cruelty” of
raising the Social Security retirement age–a policy I think is smart on
almost every dimension.  </p>

<p>The Social Security system was designed after the Great Depression to do
two things: keep old people out of poverty and insure against disability
that prevents people from working to support themselves.  The disability
insurance part of Social Security is less well-known than its retirement
benefits but is very important and I have nothing to say about it today.
You’ll note that I didn’t mention a third objective: funding a long
retirement for most people after they’ve worked a sufficient number of
years.  The Social Security system is expected to provide this now, but
it certainly wasn’t at the beginning.</p>

<p>In 1930, the average white 20 year old male could be expected to live to
age 66 (<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html">source</a>).  If he
made it to age 40, he could expect to live to age 69, and if he made it
to age 50, his expected age of death increased to about 72 years.  During
the bulk of the years he contributed to Social Security, he was
expecting a fairly short (1 to 7 year) period after age 65 when he could
actually retire with full benefits.  Even FDR didn’t see the goal as
funding people’s “golden years”:</p>

<pre><code>"We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against
one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we
have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection
to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job
and against poverty-ridden old age."

-- President Roosevelt upon signing Social Security Act ([source](http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html))
</code></pre>

<p>Contrast this with the experiences of people in 2004 (the latest year I
could easily find data). A 20 year old expected to live to 77 years, a
40 year old to 78 years, and a 50 year old to 79 years.  The expected
duration of retirement ranged from 12 to 14 years.  Krugman is right
that the expected length of retirement upon reaching age 65 has not
changed all <em>that</em> much
(<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/basicfact.htm">from 14 years to almost 20 years</a>),
but that’s irrelevant to people’s expectations during working life.</p>

<p>Other things have changed since the Social Security was enacted too.
While original benefits were high enough to keep retirees out of
poverty, modern levels replace a much larger fraction of income.  Jobs
are a lot less physically demanding today.  In 1940, 26.7% of those
employed worked on farms or did miscellaneous forms of physical labor
relative to just 5.9% in 1990.  And in 1940, only 21.3% of workers were
managers, officials, clerical workers, or professionals.  This ballooned
to more than half the work force by 1990.  (More detailed breakdowns
<a href="http://www.demographicchartbook.com/Chartbook/images/figures/fig16-1.pdf">here</a>).
Finally, I’m pretty sure physical health of those who do survive to 65
is better now than it has been in the past though I couldn’t easily find
data to back that up.</p>

<p>Most people who reach 65<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are strongly enouraged by the incentives in
the Social Security system to retire even though they are perfectly
capable of being highly productive members of the work force.  I believe
their experience is a huge untapped resource for the economy.  But what
of the people that Krugman is worried about: Those who worked physically
stressful jobs for years and at age 65 don’t expect to live all that
much longer.  I have a heart and I worry about this group too.  Suppose
we let people retire at age 65 but capped their benefits at a relatively
low level.  This constraint would be unbinding for those who worked low
paying (and more likely physically demanding) jobs.  At the same time,
it would encourage relatively wealthier (and healthier) folks to work
until they were, say, 70 years old.  If wealthier people really want to
retire earlier, they can save more during their working lives and rely
on Social Security for what it was designed: insurance against poverty
in old age.  We all win!</p>

<p>benefits at 62 and higher benefits if they wait until the “full
retirement age” of 65.  The amounts are designed to make the people
fairly indifferent between the two dates.  In the next few years, the
full retirement age will be going up to age 67 (details
<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/agereduction.htm">here</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a week before Halloween, R and I raided the library’s selection of
Halloween-appropriate picture books.  I’ve felt
<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/21370720836/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-2">guilty before</a>
about skimming the cream but hopefully sharing what we learned
will balance out the karma.  Before I start, I know what you’re
thinking: “It’s the middle of November!  Who cares about Halloween?  How about sharing something useful
like the top 10 Thanksgiving picture books?”  Don’t worry, that’ll be
here before Christmas.  In the meantime, bookmark this page and put a

of my favorite recurring lovable-yet-flawed characters.  He’s just a
regular kid (turtle) who usually gets in some sort of minor trouble
and learns from his mistakes.  He’s kind of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">messy</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Plays-Game-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590226312">not very athletic</a>,
and has even been known to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Fibs-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590446479">tell a fib or two</a>.  In this book, he just
has fun making his own Halloween costume and going to a party.
There’s a great spooky twist at the end and he’s even generous to a
sick friend.  Hurray for Franklin!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brooms-Are-Flying-Michael-Rex/dp/0312380151">Brooms Are for Flying</a> (by Michael Rex) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humbug-Witch-Lorna-Balian/dp/159572009X">Humbug Witch</a> (by
Lorna Bailin) Spoiler Alert!  These two books are simple and cute.
One is about a witch who turns out to be a girl at the end and the
other is about a girl who turns out to be a witch at the end!  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WITCH-WHO-LIVES-DOWN-HALL/dp/B000J4MU7I">The Witch Who Lives Down the Hall</a> (by Donna Guthrie, illustrated
by Amy Schwartz) The mostly black and white illustrations (with
touches of orange) are a great complement to a story about a boy who
lives down the hall from a “strange” lady and her black cat.  He’s
convinced she’s a witch.  Clever and funny to both kids and adults.
Reminded me a lot of <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18359444436/kid-book-review-monster-edition">Mrs. Muffly’s Monster</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Halloween-Night-James-Stevenson/dp/0688099327">That Terrible Halloween Night</a>
  (by James Stevenson) This is about as scary as you can get and still
  be appropriate for a three year-old. I loved it and R is still talking
  about it.  Last night she told me our basement floor was covered with
  frogs!  I liked the pen and pastel comic book layout too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cake-Girl-David-Lucas/dp/B003NHR9OM">Cake Girl</a> (by David Lucas) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Lucas/e/B001HMTVBY">David Lucas</a> is so good–all his books
have such sweet characters, surreal stories, and pretty
illustrations.  This one is about a witch who learns about friendship.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two of my favorite bloggers (<a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="http://brooksreview.net">Ben Brooks</a>) recently
published passionate <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/05/06/bathroom-fan-timer-switches">love</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/amazon-item/">letters</a> to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TJAGPS">Panasonic WhisperCeiling</a> bathroom
fan, and in Marco’s case, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00313JXB0">Leviton electronic timer switch</a>.  Since
our downstairs bathroom has had no fan at all for more than a year, and
our upstairs bathroom fan sounded like a jet engine (and took 20 minutes
to de-fog a mirror), I took this as a sign that it was time to upgrade.
It was harder than expected to find an electrician to install them, but
today was the big day.  It’s worked out pretty well for our upstairs
bathroom, but not so much for the downstairs bathroom.  In fact, I was
surprised by three issues that were unmentioned in the “reviews” I read:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Panasonic WhisperLite fan/light combo unit is approximately
square and it doesn’t fit in our downstairs bathroom because we have a
cast-iron drain pipe running 8.5” away from the stud where the fan has
to be mounted.  Drat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulbs in the WhisperLite are compact-fluorescent and they send
out a very white light.  I like it, but my wife calls it “institutional”
and she says it reminds her of a public restroom.  This isn’t exactly
where anyone wants to be taking a shower, and if she doesn’t acclimate, I’m
hoping we can just change the bulbs to something a little softer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leviton switch requires three wires (including a neutral) and our
downstairs bathroom only has two.  If I want a timer switch we either
spend $200 to run a new line (I’m not <em>that</em> crazy) or we get one of
those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intermatic-FD15MWC-15-Minute-Spring-Loaded/dp/B000EVS4WG">spring-loaded knobs</a> that screams hotel sauna.  For now, we’re
sticking with the old manual switch.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To be fair, the new fan is very quiet and is working like a champ–our
upstairs bathroom isn’t small and during a leisurely shower the mirror
never fogged up.  And the Leviton timer is far more reliable than I was
about remembering to turn off the fan when it’s done its job.  But I
think there is a bigger lesson here: Some products that are perfect for
some people (or bathrooms) are not perfect for others, and we shouldn’t
let ourselves be blinded by the opinions of fan-bois.</p>

<time datetime="2012-10-25T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 25<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple’s big October product announcements are now behind us and I’ve
read more blogger reactions than I care to admit.  Even I’m surprised
that I still have a few somewhat original thoughts of my own to share.
Instead of simply being an “iPad mini” event Apple announced a whole
slew of products.  While some folks predicted some of the “extra”
stuff, I don’t think anyone expected the sheer quantity we saw.  That
said, I’m most excited about two products Apple did not announce:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A new Thunderbolt display:</strong> The new iMac is beautiful and I can’t
wait until they translate it into a stand-alone display.  Less glare and
pixels closer to the glass will be terrific.  It will also give Apple a
chance to add a few ports that they neglected on the first rev: USB 3
and analog audio out.  And imagine how thin it will be when it doesn’t
have to also house a whole computer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Fusion Drive:</strong> I know, I know, they DID announce this as an
option for the new iMac and Mac Mini, but I’m hoping they will sell it
separately so I can stick one in my 2010 iMac.  I really like the idea
of having the speed of an SSD and the size of a traditional HD without
the hassle of managing the pair.  We’ll have to wait for the iFixit
teardown to see if it has a new interface (and is thus incompatible) and
something tells me even if it has standard wiring, Apple will want to
reserve this feature as reason for folks to upgrade their old (but
perfectly usable) iMacs.  I can still dream.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s been a lot of talk about how Apple is making a mistake by
pricing the iPad mini at $329 and leaving breathing room for the other
cheaper small tablets in the market.  I think Apple priced the product
as high as possible such that they will sell all the mini’s they can make
before the holidays.  If they didn’t, they would simply be leaving money
on the table.  When their supply chain gets up to speed some time in the
spring, I predict they will drop the price below $300.</p>

<p>I have very mixed feelings about the new iMac.  While it’s gorgeous and
powerful, I’m not sure I agree with the sacrifices Apple had to make to
achieve its super-model-thin curves.  Most iMac owners spend
the bulk of their time in <em>front</em> of their iMac where they never even
see the curves–my own is right up against a wall, and I’d have to lean
over and around my desk to appreciate the sides and back.</p>

<p>Apple loves to be first to cast old standards aside: Remember when the
iMac dropped the floppy drive?  I think they were the first PC maker to
stop using special keyboard and mouse ports and just rely on USB.  And
just a month ago they said goodbye to the venerable Dock Connector.  Now
they want to do the same thing to the optical drive.  For a notebook,
this makes perfect sense: In the last year there was exactly one time
when it would have been nice to mount a CD on my Air and that is
certainly not enough to justify the added weight and bulk of a drive.
At my desk, I do rip the occasional DVD or used CD.  And I’m certainly
not throwing my iMac in my bag when I head out on the town.  But maybe
Apple’s right.  Maybe folks should just keep an ugly old SuperDrive in a
drawer for those rare occasions when they need it.  Then they can
appreciate beautiful design every day.  Even if it means leaning over
their desks to do so.</p>

HISSSSSS!
 
                  by Laura Whipple
</code></pre>

<p>As you may remember from <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/22767550387/carle-vs-lionni-no-accounting-for-taste">my last post</a>, my older daughter loves Greek
mythology, but the stories are hopelessly age-inappropriate. We’ve been
reading them anyway and I try to tone them down on the fly with limited
success.  What I’ve really wanted was something that could extract the
magic and wonder of the creatures and leave the ultra-violence and the
mixed moral messages behind.  It turns out I owe Eric Carle an apology
because he’s published exactly the book I was looking for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eric-Carles-Dragons-Carle/dp/014240103X">Dragons, Dragons</a> combines Eric Carle’s admittedly pretty
collage pictures with poems about 30 mythical creatures from around the
world.  Many are from Greek myths (e.g., Cerberus, Pegasus, the
Minotaur!) but they also hail from Japan (kappa), Africa (Okolo), the
Americas (Quetzalcoatl), Australia (bunyip), the Middle East
(manticore and roc), and other places.  In some cases the artistic representations don’t
match the images in my head (in addition to his lion’s head, the
chimaera has a goat’s head sprouting out of his back!) but considering
we don’t have any actual specimens to determine who is “correct,” I
don’t mind.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the book is the poetry.  Why should mythical
creatures be constrained to prose?  To accompany his illustrations,
Mr. Carle has chosen work ranging from classic (William Blake and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning) to poets I’ve never heard of but are a lot
of fun (see Laura Whipple’s contribution above).  R learns vocabulary
when we read them and she definitely appreciates the vivid word pictures
and rhymes.  She’s already memorized a few of the poems and there’s even
one (the Phoenix) that is written specifically for two voices.</p>

<p><a href="http://highvariance.net/post/22767550387/carle-vs-lionni-no-accounting-for-taste">I’m still not a fan</a> of all of Eric Carle’s work, but this book is almost perfect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My 3.5 year old daughter wants to be a minotaur for Halloween. She loves
the idea of a person with a bull’s head. She knows that minotaurs live
in labyrinths and eat humans.  For her costume, she wants to carry an
axe.  And whenever we play minotaur, she wants me to be Theseus and she
often wants to “fight to death!”  Someday she’ll know what death is and
understand the consequences of a real fight, but for now these are just
fun words to say.</p>

<p>It all started more than a year ago when she was in a phase where she
wanted me to tell her new stories all the time.  And I mean about 25
times per day.  I quickly ran out of kid stories and moved on to stories
about my old pets and stories about my childhood.  Then I remembered the
Greeks had some good stories and started telling her about Daedalus and
Icarus, Pandora’s Box, and the 12 Labors of Heracles.  She thought they
were great and I ordered a copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greek-Myths-Young-Children-Heather/dp/0794530494">Greek Myths for Young Children</a> which was age inappropriate
(despite the title) but at least jogged my memory for a few more
stories.</p>

<p>About a month ago I brought out the book again and she loved it so much
she asked for a new Greek myth as her bed-time story every night.  She
especially loved the vivid characters and creatures, and she can now
tell you that Prince Bellerophon rode Pegasus, Cerberus has three heads,
and a Chimaera has the body of a goat, head of a lion and a snake for a
tail.  The stories were violent, but the language was relatively tame.</p>

<p>I was ambivalent about the situation, but then we crossed a line when I
picked up a few more “kids” mythology books at the library.  Suddenly
instead of just eating humans, the minotaur “had a taste for human
flesh.”  Centaurs were getting drunk and chasing bridesmaids and the
sphinx was tearing apart unfortunate travelers and devouring them.  I
skipped a lot of this, but then the babysitter started reading the
stories verbatim.  It was bad.</p>

<p>Now some people might wonder what the big deal is.  Weren’t old fairy
tales really violent too?  Didn’t Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother
get eaten by a wolf?  Didn’t Hansel and Gretel get cooked in an oven?
Indeed, they did.  And those fairy tales werre written at a time when
violence was a normal part of everyday life.  Public life in the middle
class United Stated is far far less violent today and we run a pretty
pacifist household.  Violent fairy tales are not “keeping it real” for
us. I feel no need to expose my girls to realistic stories of violence
until they’ve got the tools to understand and process it.  I don’t want
to violence to be normal.  I don’t want them scared that if they go in
the woods they will get eaten by a witch or a wolf.  I don’t want them
playing fighting games at school even if they seem fun or even funny.</p>

<p>The time will come when all the violence that exists in pop culture on
tv, in the theater, at the movies, and in grown-up books will push
through our walls and into their lives.  And hopefully by that time they
will be old enough to know that it’s serious business.</p>

<p>Does this mean we’re banning Greek myths from house?  Not exactly.
We’re trying a compromise solution.  For now, I edit as I read. Theseus
and the Minotaur fight, but not always to the death.  Heracles has a
simpler young adulthood where he does not “fly into a rage and kill all
his children.”  And Theseus’ father doesn’t leap off a cliff to his
death because his son forgot to fly the white sail.  When the girls are
older they can read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bulfinchs-Mythology-Volumes-Chivalry-Charlemagne/dp/1440426309">Bullfinch’s</a> on their own and get maximum
mayhem. Until then Theseus and the Minotaur can be friends who
occasionally walk Cerberus around the block.</p>
