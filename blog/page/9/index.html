  <div class="entry-content"><p>My 3.5 year old daughter wants to be a minotaur for Halloween. She loves
the idea of a person with a bull’s head. She knows that minotaurs live
in labyrinths and eat humans.  For her costume, she wants to carry an
axe.  And whenever we play minotaur, she wants me to be Theseus and she
often wants to “fight to death!”  Someday she’ll know what death is and
understand the consequences of a real fight, but for now these are just
fun words to say.</p>

<p>It all started more than a year ago when she was in a phase where she
wanted me to tell her new stories all the time.  And I mean about 25
times per day.  I quickly ran out of kid stories and moved on to stories
about my old pets and stories about my childhood.  Then I remembered the
Greeks had some good stories and started telling her about Daedalus and
Icarus, Pandora’s Box, and the 12 Labors of Heracles.  She thought they
were great and I ordered a copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greek-Myths-Young-Children-Heather/dp/0794530494">Greek Myths for Young Children</a> which was age inappropriate
(despite the title) but at least jogged my memory for a few more
stories.</p>

<p>About a month ago I brought out the book again and she loved it so much
she asked for a new Greek myth as her bed-time story every night.  She
especially loved the vivid characters and creatures, and she can now
tell you that Prince Bellerophon rode Pegasus, Cerberus has three heads,
and a Chimaera has the body of a goat, head of a lion and a snake for a
tail.  The stories were violent, but the language was relatively tame.</p>

<p>I was ambivalent about the situation, but then we crossed a line when I
picked up a few more “kids” mythology books at the library.  Suddenly
instead of just eating humans, the minotaur “had a taste for human
flesh.”  Centaurs were getting drunk and chasing bridesmaids and the
sphinx was tearing apart unfortunate travelers and devouring them.  I
skipped a lot of this, but then the babysitter started reading the
stories verbatim.  It was bad.</p>

<p>Now some people might wonder what the big deal is.  Weren’t old fairy
tales really violent too?  Didn’t Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother
get eaten by a wolf?  Didn’t Hansel and Gretel get cooked in an oven?
Indeed, they did.  And those fairy tales werre written at a time when
violence was a normal part of everyday life.  Public life in the middle
class United Stated is far far less violent today and we run a pretty
pacifist household.  Violent fairy tales are not “keeping it real” for
us. I feel no need to expose my girls to realistic stories of violence
until they’ve got the tools to understand and process it.  I don’t want
to violence to be normal.  I don’t want them scared that if they go in
the woods they will get eaten by a witch or a wolf.  I don’t want them
playing fighting games at school even if they seem fun or even funny.</p>

<p>The time will come when all the violence that exists in pop culture on
tv, in the theater, at the movies, and in grown-up books will push
through our walls and into their lives.  And hopefully by that time they
will be old enough to know that it’s serious business.</p>

<p>Does this mean we’re banning Greek myths from house?  Not exactly.
We’re trying a compromise solution.  For now, I edit as I read. Theseus
and the Minotaur fight, but not always to the death.  Heracles has a
simpler young adulthood where he does not “fly into a rage and kill all
his children.”  And Theseus’ father doesn’t leap off a cliff to his
death because his son forgot to fly the white sail.  When the girls are
older they can read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bulfinchs-Mythology-Volumes-Chivalry-Charlemagne/dp/1440426309">Bullfinch’s</a> on their own and get maximum
mayhem. Until then Theseus and the Minotaur can be friends who
occasionally walk Cerberus around the block.</p>

<time datetime="2012-10-02T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 2<span>nd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I got my iPhone 5 about a week ago (pre-ordered from AT&amp;T) and have
barely been able to brag about it to anyone since most of my local
friends aren’t nearly as nerdy as I am.  Then I remembered that I had a
blog and decided the world needed hear all about my new device.</p>

<p>But first, a little background: Two years ago I started carrying an
iPhone 4 and a year ago I was only slightly tempted to upgrade to a 4S.
The camera was a little better, the cpu was a little faster, and it had
Siri which I didn’t think I’d use much.  And I would have had to pay the
one year upgrade penalty.  I passed.  Fast-forward to this year and I
was champing at the bit for something new.  </p>

<p>And so, without further ado, here’s what I’d say if you saw me on the
street and said “Ooh, is that an iPhone 5?  How do you like it?”</p>

<h2 id="big-stuff">Big Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>Camera:</strong> It’s way better.  Low light pictures look a lot better, but
 the thing I really notice is the speed.  It launches quickly (the 4 was
 a dog), and you can tap away at the shutter seemingly several times a
 second.  It’s a life-saver when you have an older daughter who loves
 funny faces and chewing on her own hair, but occasionally flashes the
 most beautiful smile you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p><strong>Maps:</strong> I get it that if you live in a place where the coverage stinks,
 the new Maps app stinks too.  But in New Haven, the coverage is fine.
 And it’s huge upgrade over IOS 5 both in terms of features and UI.
 Turn-by-turn voice directions are extremely well integrated–much nicer
 and more functional than either Tom Tom or Navigon.  I love that you
 can flip back and forth between the 2D map of your route and the 3D
 rendering of where you are on the route.  The vector-based tiles are
 prettier and faster to download too.  I’m glad I have the Tom Tom app,
which stores maps locally, for when I’m out of cell range, but let’s
 be honest: that hasn’t happened in years and it will be a while before
 it happens again.</p>

<p><strong>CPU:</strong> It’s way faster.  I have a shortcut on my home screen that launches
OmniFocus and goes straight to “new task” screen.  It used to take about
5 seconds, but now it’s less than a second.  All sorts of other stuff
loads and runs faster too.</p>

<p><strong>64 GB flash:</strong> In this cloud-based age we live in, local storage isn’t
 supposed to matter since your apps should just be able to pull in what
 you need from the net as you need it.  But as I’ve complained bitterly
 about <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/19041134391/photos-iphoto-ios-icloud-im-underwhelmed">already</a>, Apple’s vision of cloud photography is currently
 Photo Stream.  Ugh.  With double the room on my device, both my wife
 and I can stop carefully deciding what pictures and home videos we have
 space for.  Some day <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/revel.html">Adobe Revel</a> might solve this more elegantly,
 but for now they don’t do video and they don’t have a Windows app.</p>

<h2 id="little-stuff">Little Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>The physical device:</strong> Yeah, it’s nice.  But my eyes aren’t good enough to
really appreciate the straight lines and shiny camfer.  And it’s really
thin, especially since I’m going caseless for now compared to my old
rubber-clad 4.  It feels great in the pocket but it’s surprisingly hard
to pick up off a counter or desk!  My wife thinks it feels a little like
a Nano, and she’s right.</p>

<p><strong>Screen:</strong> I can’t tell if the colors are more saturated or if the pixels
are closer to the surface but supposedly they are.  It’s nice to have
more text on the screen in portrait mode, but this is partially offset
by the awkwardness of moving my thumb to the opposite top corner.  This
has become easier with time, so I’m guessing I’ll completely
adjust soon.  The extra row of icons is useful as my home screen was
getting a little cramped.  I rarely venture to my other screens now, and
that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Lightning:</strong> I like it a lot–it’s durable, tiny, and easy since it’s
double-sided.  It’s a little annoying that I now need different cables
for my phone and iPad, but Apple had to upgrade this connector
eventually and I think we’ll have Lightning for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>LTE:</strong> in some ways, this is the biggest new feature of the phone. When
you’re near an LTE tower, it’s crazy fast–the other day SpeedTest gave
me 28Mbps downstream and 12 Mbps upstream.  That’s 3x and 8x faster than
my U-Verse at home!  Of course, per byte, it’s expensive and I’m on wifi
90% of the time.  And right now, AT&amp;T’s coverage isn’t that great.</p>

<p><strong>Siri:</strong> We’re still just getting to know each other, but I like what I
 hear so far.  It’s absolutely the fastest way to enter new appointments
 on my calendar.  Last Friday I asked “What was the score in last
 night’s NFL game?” and got the box score in moments.  I use it to set
 alarms.  I expected to enjoy the novelty of it and then forget about
 it, but instead my usage seems to be increasing.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts:</h2>

<p>This phone did not need a whole bunch of fancy new features (e.g.,
curved AMOLED display, NFC, giant screen) to be fantastic.  The iPhone
has been fantastic since they introduced it in 2007.  I find it amazing
that they’ve been able to make it incrementally better every year by
refining and improving what it already does.  And yet the tech press
keeps wanting the next iPhone to be a quantum leap.  That’s not how
how it works.  Truly revolutionary devices aren’t 5.0’s, they are
1.0’s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think of myself as a reasonably creative guy.  I’m not always coming
up with particularly useful or imporant ideas, but I like to think
they’re fairly unique.  Unique in a small town or among your friends is
one thing, but unique on the Internet is quite another.  I thought it
would be fun to share some ideas I had for posts that turned out be less
original than I first thought.</p>

<h2 id="is-height-normal">Is height normal?</h2>

<p>Adult height is one of the prototypical examples of a naturally
occurring normal distribution, but if you look at real data, it’s not
perfectly normal.  First off, it’s a mixture of men and women who
individually have pretty normal heights but quite different means (by
about 5”).  Second, the tails of the distribution are fatter than
normal.  That is, extremely short and tall people are far more common
than predicted by a pure normal distribution.  All this is explained
very nicely explained in two 2008 posts (<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-normally-distributed/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/11/25/distribution-of-adult-heights/">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-not-normally-distributed/">here</a>) by John D. Cook at <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">The Endeavor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nietzsche-and-pop-music">Nietzsche and pop music</h2>

<p>There aren’t very many 19th or 20th Century philosophers that inspire
pop songs. The Cure turned Albert Camus’ The Stranger into “Staring at
the Sea”, but up until a few weeks ago I thought that was it.  How wrong I
was!  Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I">What Doesn’t Kill You</a>” has been getting
tremendous airplay on pop stations and it’s not much different from
Christina Aguilera’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOJpIwF47Y">Fighter</a>” which also talks about how being
beaten down just makes her “stronger”, “harder”, and “wiser”.  And it
turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujhZoAg2-I">tons and tons of songs</a> have been inspired by this
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn159167.html">Nietzsche quote</a>.  I thought it would be fun to see how many more of
Nietzsche’s ideas (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#.C3.9Cbermensch">Superman</a>)  have been translated into pop
music (maybe “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan#Sunshine_Superman">Sunshine Superman</a>”?).  Turns out Craig
Schuftan has written a <a href="http://startnarrativehere.com/2010/01/hey-nietzsche-leave-them-kids-alone-the-romantic-movement-rock-roll-and-the-end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-by-craig-schuftan-2009">whole book</a> about this called
<em>Hey! Nietzsche! Leave Them Kids Alone!: The Romantic Movement, Rock &amp;
Roll, and the End of Civilisation as We Know It</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-impact-of-cleaning-the-augean-stables">The environmental impact of cleaning the Augean stables</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">The Fifth Labor of Heracles</a> was to clean the Augean stables.
They were so dirty and filthy that he had to divert two rivers through
them to wash out the manure that 1000 cattle had produced over thirty
years.  This reminded me of what happened when hurricanes hit North
Carolina a few years ago and pushed massive amounts of pig waste into
the water supply.  Wouldn’t it be interesting to write a quick
environmental impact statement for Hercules’ act?  A few people have
noticed that the effects were probably pretty serious (<a href="http://thepunnery.wordpress.com/tag/augean-stables/">The Punnery</a>,
<a href="http://hazwastemanagement.info/HazWasteManagement_Solutions/Chapter_16_HWM_2nd_ed_Solutions.pdf">this homework assignment</a> for a class on Hazardous Waste Management)
but no one has actually done any calculations to show how serious.
Hmm….maybe I can contribute something here!</p>

<h2 id="a-sitcom-about-a-woman-with-cancer">A sitcom about a woman with cancer.</h2>

<p>Last month I had a strange dream about developing a sitcom that starred
a woman who is diagnosed with cancer and goes through the whole
treatment process.  The story would have a full three year arc with
cliff-hangers every year when she (or her new best friend who also has
cancer) goes in for testing.  The final episode would be her saying
goodbye.  The show would have lots of funny kids, hair loss jokes, and
nausea jokes.  She could also start a romantic relationship in the
middle of the run.  An awfully large number of people have either had
cancer by now or had someone very close go through it.  I really believe
that a show like this would have a big audience of people who want to
laugh about a serious thing.  Showtime also believed this and started
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_C_(TV_series)">The Big C</a>” in 2010 and it’s entering its third season now.
According to Wikipedia, it’s been very successful since the beginning!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every year or so I get cranky about my task management system and switch
to something new.  This year it’s particularly bad because I’ve been
hearing the Siren Song of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.  I swear every nerd blogger I read
uses it: e.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/08/omnifocus-v-things-mac-ipad-iphone/">The Brooks Review</a></li>
  <li>David Sparks at <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/7/30/ipad-omnifocus-review.html">MacSparky</a></li>
  <li>Aleh Cherp at <a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2012/04/02/task-management-with-omnifocus-collecting-and-processing/">Macademic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I even believe John Gruber (<a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>) uses it though he’s a
little cagy since they are often a sponsor of his.</p>

<p>BUT, I strongly believe you shouldn’t switch systems unless you’re
solving specific problems.  That is, I invest in my systems and don’t
want to switch just for fun.  Hearing that some other piece of software
is “really good” or even “better” than what you’re currently using
isn’t good enough for me.</p>

<p>Last year when I made the switch from <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a> to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>
(RTM), I had some clear requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cross-platform</em>: I was spending time on Mac, Windows, iPad, and
 iPhone and I needed to be able to access my tasks from all of them.</li>
  <li><em>Rock solid invisible sync</em>: I never wanted to think about which
 version of my task list I was working with.  There should be just one
 master copy (preferably in the cloud) that gets seemlessly accessed
 and updated from various clients.</li>
  <li><em>Power and flexibility</em>: Google Tasks met the first two criteria, but it was just too
 simple.  I wanted more than due dates and separate lists.  I wanted
 to be able to attach priorities, contexts, durations, and other
 arbitrary tags.  I wanted to  dynamically create lists based on
 these characteristics that showed me just what I wanted (and was
 able) to do at any particular moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time, RTM was the best solution, but the world has changed since
then.  Omnifocus now provides highly regarded Sync Services.  And I’ve
shed my need for Windows now that I carry a MacBook Air with me
everywhere i go.</p>

<p>Stepping up a level for a moment, the overall task management system you
use is far more important than the particular tool you use to implement
it.  I’m a GTD (Getting Things Done) guy, though I’m not the most
orthodox devotee you’ll meet.  There are two things I love about GTD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You get the mental to do list out of your head.  Since you’re not
constantly worrying that you’ll forget something, your mind is freed up
for more interesting creative work.  And you’re not forgetting things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once your tasks are organized, GTD provides a way to quickly see what
you can and should be doing in any given context.  This is exactly what
I couldn’t do with Google Tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After a year of experience (and tweeking), I’ve got an implementation of
my GTD system in Remember The Milk that works pretty well.  Before
casting it aside for a new pretty young thing, I’m going to describe my
system and what works and doesn’t work for me.  It’s almost certainly
not a perfect match for anyone else, but it might give you ideas for
things to try or think about.  </p>

<p>RTM is a simple system that lets you build complex systems on top of it.
Basically, you just define a bunch of lists of tasks with
characteristics.  These characteristics include priorities, due dates,
durations, locations, and arbitrary tags–exactly what I want.  The
power comes from defining Smart Lists that are basically saved searches
based on these characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Even though RTM supports multiple lists, I keep almost all my tasks in
the Inbox list and use other lists only for storing things like books
I’d like to read or ideas for upcoming posts.  I define my projects with
tags.  Home-related projects have tags starting with “ph-“ (e.g.,
“ph-basement”) and work-related projects have tags starting with “pw-“.
Most tasks that go into the system have either a project assigned or a simple
“work” tag.  If it’s a single task home project, I don’t take the time
to assign a project tag at all.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>I assign each task a single location tag: at-desk, at-phone, at-home,
at-econoffice, at-errand, or at-wife.  The last one is special: tasks
that require consultation with my wife.  Someone else that runs a lot of
errands might find it worth their time to set up several locations that
cause tasks to pop up when they go somewhere, but generally I go
somewhere <em>because</em> I need to do something and so don’t need to get
reminded.</p>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p>Coming up with the right set of contexts is critical to the system and
it’s the hardest part. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">The GTD Book</a>, David Allen talks a lot about home,
office, and phone. With smart phones, the set of things you can do “on
the phone” is far larger than it used to be.  Since I usually have my
laptop with me and most of my resources are online, home office,
work office, and even cafe are almost the same.</p>

<p>Right now I have four smart lists that define my contexts:</p>

<p><strong>c-working</strong> </p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (list:Inbox and (tagContains:pw- or
tag:work or tag:weekday) and (dueWithin:"5 days of today" or
priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the context I look at during the work day or at night when
I’m working.  It includes everything due today or that’s overdue so I
don’t miss deadlines.  It also includes any tasks associated with
work-related projects or that can only be done during the week
(<tt>tag:weekday</tt>).  The most interesting piece is where I drop all
tasks that are due more than five days from now that have no priority
assigned.  These are the tasks I don’t even want to think about until it
gets closer to their due date.</p>

<p><strong>c-weekend</strong></p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (not tag:work and not
tagContains:pw- and not tag:weekday and list:Inbox and (dueWithin:"5
days of today" or priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On weekends and any time I want to focus on the non-work part of my
life I check this list.  It’s almost the inverse of my work context
except that it also includes anything that’s due or past due.</p>

<p><strong>c-out</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:at-errand or tag:at-phone
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I should and can do when I’m out and about.</p>

<p><strong>c-easy</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:fun or tag:easy or timeEstimate:"&lt; 1 hour"
</code></pre>

<p>When I’m tired or just have a few minutes, I look at this list.  It’s my
newest context, and I might eventually break it into a tired list and a
separate quick-task list.  </p>

<p>All four of these Smart Lists are sorted first by due date and then by
priority.  I often use <strong>high priority</strong> to mark that a task is the
next action for a project.  This way it’s always listed before other
actions that I want to record but might not be ready to do.  A while
back I read <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">another article</a> about implementing GTD in RTM and it
suggested using an <strong>na</strong> tag.  My system allows me to complete a task
for a project and have the other tasks still show up on the list.  The
last thing I want to do is to constantly be tagging new tasks as <strong>na</strong>
as I complete other tasks.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when I want to focus on a particular project
and in those cases I simply look at the Tag view for the project and
see all the tasks associated with the project no matter when they are
due or what their priority.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly Review:</h2>

<p>Just as David Allen says, I’ve found that if I don’t do a weekly review,
the information in the system drifts away from the information in my
brain and loses its value.  That’s when most folks fall off the wagon.
So support for the weekly review process is super-important.  Here’s
what I do every week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at my untagged Smart List (<tt>not isTagged:true list:Inbox</tt>)
and assign project (if necessary) or location tags</li>
  <li>Look at the tasks for each project:
    <ul>
      <li>Are any upcoming tasks missing?  </li>
      <li>Are priorities and due dates right?</li>
      <li>Can I delete any tasks that are no longer needed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any new projects that didn’t make it into the system during the week</li>
  <li>Quickly look at all the tasks in the system (usually between 100 and 150)
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need to lower / raise any priorities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look at what I accomplished in last week (<tt>completedWithin:”1 week
of today”</tt>)–good for setting feasible future expectations </li>
</ul>

<p>One nice thing about this way of doing weekly reviews is that it can be
done in chunks here and there –I don’t have to set aside the
traditional 2-3 hour block.</p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>

<p>On the whole, I’m pretty happy with my system, but that doesn’t mean
there’s not lots of room for improvement.  </p>

<p>First, my system isn’t that great for capturing or doing long range
planning.  I can’t specify task dependencies and I can’t even specify
start dates for tasks.  If I could, that would let me filter out tasks
that I know I’m not starting for a while.  I try to follow orthodox GTD
practice and only use due dates for when things are really due. That way
I don’t miss these things in a sea of stuff that I’d like to be done on
that day.</p>

<p>Second, while the iOS apps are very good, I’m getting tired of the
clunky RTM web interface.  It’s functional, but pretty ugly.   I use
Fluid to make RTM a pop down menubar app, but I can’t get it to play
well with multiple Spaces.  That is, when I pop down the app, it pulls
me back to the Space I first started it.  And when RTM automatically
logs me out of the website (more often than I’d like), 
<a href="http://support.agilebits.com/discussions/1password-38-for-mac-from-agilebits-website/11718-1password-with-fluid">I can’t use 1Password to log back bin</a>.  I’m still totally dumbfounded that
no one has built a decent native Mac app for the service.</p>

<p>Third, entering new tasks requires me to click on the menubar app and
then put the cursor in the new task text entry box.  It sure would be
nice to have a global hot key for this.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Remember The Milk bugs me, but it also works for me.  And maybe
Omnifocus wouldn’t be uniformly better.  I’m worried that it would
try to force me into new ways of doing things that just don’t match my
work flow.  Maybe instead I need to check out <a href="http://donaldjenkins.com/2012/02/why-i-switched-from-omnifocus-to-things/">Things</a>….  Or maybe I
just need to get back to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been times in my life when I’ve listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I’m pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get—that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don’t feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I’ve started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I’m as surprised as you are as I’ve always been an “I don’t like
country” guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I’m not totally sure what’s changed, but over the last few weeks
I’ve Shazamed several songs that I’ve had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">“Country Must Be Country Wide”</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it’s so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80’s.  It’s got awesome guitar and great lines like
“In every state there’s a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon”.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">“Got My Country On”</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is “Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars”.  He
even says he’s “Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">“This”</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn’t be more earnest: “Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this.”  I’ve never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">“Drink On It”</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It’s about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this will country thing be a fad for me.  Or maybe I’ll be wearing Wranglers and
cowboy boots by this time next year.  I’ll definitely pass on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/smokeless">Skoal</a> though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve always wanted to live life efficiently.  When I was in third grade
I made a list of all the chores I had to do every morning (like make the
bed) and timed myself doing them. I even made my mom assign quality
grades to each task to make sure I wasn’t sacrificing on that margin for
speed.</p>

<p>I don’t make my bed anymore, but I do grade a lot of papers and I like
to give copious feedback. The returns to optimizing this process are
big. That’s why I recently decided to try out several iPad PDF
annotation apps to find the one that best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>My needs aren’t extreme. I mostly want to highlight, strike-through, and
add colored text. Occasionally I want to underline, add a long note, or
draw a shape. And since all my documents live on Dropbox, I want to
easily sync whole folders. It turns out there are at least three apps
that can do all of these things, but they have some important
differences in how they get there.  Here’s what I’ve found:</p>

<h2 id="goodreader-314"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">GoodReader 3.14</a></h2>

<p>GoodReader has been my go-to annotation app for the last six months, and
it sets the bar high.  The only real annoyance is that you have to enter
inline comments (i.e., use the typewriter tool) in a popup editing
window before the app drops your words into the document.  Once
there, it’s easy to grab the comment (by holding a finger on it) and
move or resize the text box.  This is critical since you never know
exactly where or how big the text box will be.  You don’t have any
control over the font for these inline comments and the one it chooses
is cheesy typewriter, but I don’t mind.</p>

<p>Syncing folders with Dropbox is great although the sync button can get
hidden way down in in the “Web Downloads” area are under a long list of
“recent” downloads.  In fact, the whole document management interface is
functional, but messy and unintuitive–i.e., once you know your way
around, you don’t waste a lot of time, but it’s never pretty and there
is a learning curve.</p>

<p>One useful feature I haven’t found in the other apps is a Back button
under the scroll bar that (obviously) puts you back where you were after
you scroll somewhere else or move to a bookmark.  This is great when
you’re flipping between text and tables.</p>

<h2 id="iannotate-pdf-21"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953">iAnnotate PDF 2.1</a></h2>

<p>iAnnotate PDF has a clunky name and a cartoony interface.  I think it’s
been around the longest and it’s extremely configurable.  People who use
it swear it does everything they want but it takes a little work up
front to set it up.  I believe them.  And when you add inline text, you
do it in the page itself which is much more natural than typing into GoodReader’s
disembodied text box.</p>

<p>On the downside, it’s been crashy for me.  I’ve been using an original
iPad, so maybe it’s more stable on newer hardware.  It doesn’t have a
scroll bar that lets you move directly to the end (or beginning) of your
document.  It doesn’t always highlight the spaces between words and I
can’t get it to autocorrect when using the typewriter tool.  But even if
these things got fixed, I just find the ugly icons too distracting.</p>

<h2 id="pdf-expert-40"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">PDF Expert 4.0</a></h2>

<p>Ah, we have a winner!  PDF Expert is a breath of fresh air.  It has
everything I like about GoodReader (except the back button) in a package
that’s just beautiful to look at.  The document management UI is
super-clean, fast, and intuitive.  It even gives you thumbnails of the
first page of each document.  The icons in the document annotation UI
are simple and classy.  When browsing a pdf, the page turns are very
fast.</p>

<p>On top of this, I don’t know how I lived without PDF Expert’s  undo and
redo commands.  They not only keep you from inadvertently junking up
your document, it means the UI doesn’t ever ask “Are you really
sure?” when you delete something because you can always roll back to the
previous state.  </p>

<p>What’s not to like?  Some people complain that it only opens one
document at a time, but I find opening and closing to be fast
enough that this isn’t a big deal.  My biggest complaint (and it’s
minor) is that you only have 9 colors to choose from for markup and
they’re kind of brash.  It’s like they were inspired by the available
colors for Apple’s <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/95875/which-smart-cover-to-get-get-a-polyurethane-one-heres-why/">cheap Smart Covers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">PDFpen</a> has been around for quite a while on the Mac, and if Preview
wasn’t as good as it was, I’d probably be using it there.  But on the
iPad, it’s the new kid on the block.  None of the positive reviews on
the app store compares it with the big three, and a few negative reviews
say it’s crashy and has fewer features.  It will probably improve over
time, but considering it costs the most ($15) and seemingly does the
least, I’m skipping it for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">Notability</a> is really a note-taking app that can also annotate PDF’s.
When I’m in a meeting or seminar, I usually use Nebulous Notes and type
right into a text file.  If I have a copy of the slides or the paper
being presented, I now take my notes right on them with PDF Expert.
Notability is particularly strong with drawing, but I find even with my
Cosmonaut stylus, the lag between moving the pen and seeing my picture
is just too unnatural to replace pen and paper.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>PDF Expert is fantastic.  I’m so glad I went through this exercise and
have graduated from GoodReader!  Of course, I could have just read Cynical
Babblings’ <a href="http://cynicalbabblings.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/pdf-editing-apps-2012-review/">recent review</a> of same apps.  I found it while I was
in the middle of my evaluation process, and he’s much more thorough than
I am.  And he also likes PDF Expert best.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On December 30, 2013 I wrote up <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/30/pdf-expert-5/">my impressions of PDF Expert 5.0</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most grown-ups, even those without kids, have heard of Eric Carle—He is
an extremely popular children’s book author who illustrates using
collage.  In fact, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Bear-What-You-See/dp/0805047905">Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do See</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Hungry-Caterpillar-Eric-Carle/dp/0399226907">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> have now supplanted Margaret Wise Brown’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0694003611">Goodnight Moon</a> as the standard gift for newborn kids.</p>

<p>Both my daughters celebrated Eric Carle week at school last month
and it got me thinking (again) just how over-rated he is.  He’s
either today’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> or the kids’ version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinkade">Thomas Kinkade</a>
(“Painter of Light”).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  With a few exceptions (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Birthday-Message-Board-Book/dp/0694011487">The Secret Birthday Message</a>), his books couldn’t be more repetitive and formulaic.</p>

<p>I’m not saying his books have no redeeming qualities—the pictures are
pretty and they do appeal to the 1-2 year old crowd. But thats not
exactly the most demanding audience and his collage style isn’t even
unique. Leo Lionni started publishing picture books with collage back in
1959 and Lois Ehlert won a Caldecott in 1989 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Board-Book-Lois-Ehlert/dp/0694010677">Color Zoo</a>.</p>

<p>Leo Lionni in particular deserves far more attention than he gets. The
only good thing about many of his books being out of print is that it
made it slightly easier to pick four Lionni books to send to my sister’s
family for Christmas.</p>

<p>Lionni was a late bloomer as a children’s book author as he had a full
career as a “real” artist before writing
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Blue-Yellow-Leo-Lionni/dp/0688132855">Little Blue and Little Yellow</a>. His stories are quirky and many push
the envelope on what’s possible in a kids’ book.  And every one has a
positive message.  For example in his first book, the characters are
splotches of color who get mixed up and turn green.  Their parents don’t
recognize them until they cry themselves apart, but then the parents recognize
their mistake and learn not to be so judgmental.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flea-Story-Leo-Lionni/dp/0905478266">A Flea Story</a>, you never even see the main characters. Instead you
only hear a dialog that’s reminiscent of Herman Hesse’s odd couple
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Narcissus-Goldmund-Hermann-Hesse/dp/B003NQOS4M">Narcissus and Goldmund</a>. One flea just wants to stay home on their
dog’s butt while the other longs for adventure. They travel together for
a while and then split to follow their own paths. Stories that appeal to
both adults and children are rare and those that do usually have two
sets of jokes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a> is the classic example). Lionni
manages to make the same things funny to all ages.</p>

<p>One of R’s favorite Lioni stories is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matthews-Dream-Leo-Lionni/dp/067987318X">Matthew’s Dream</a>. Matthew is a poor
mouse who visits a museum with his school and is inspired to be an
artist. He dreams fantastic versions of his mundane world and paints
them into reality.  Often when R paints her own pictures she says “I’m
Matthew!”</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0394829115">Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</a>, Alexander yearns to be a windup
mouse who is loved by the family instead of hated and chased with a
broom. He finds a magical lizard who will grant him his wish in exchange
for a purple pebble.  By the time he acquires one, the world has changed
and he learns to be careful what he wishes for.  R still looks for
purple pebbles to give to the lizard.</p>

<p>My one year old does like flipping through Eric Carle board books, but
as soon as she will sit still and let us read to her, she’s graduating to
Leo Lionni. The pictures are even more beautiful, the stories are
awesome, and the whole family can enjoy the ride.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>My wife thinks it’s a cheap shot comparing Carle to Kinkade, but I
never miss a chance to bring up my favorite abusive alcoholic
religious nut-job artist, even if he did pass away recently.  And the
truth is, I think his work is pretty.  Just like Eric Carle’s.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The main goal of our biweekly trip to the New Haven Free Public Library is to
pick 20 or so great picture books.  I’m looking for books with beautiful
art, lovable (or at least memorable) characters, an original story, and
a positive message.  These books are rare and they’re difficult to
identify by a book spine, a book cover, or even a quick perusal.  And I
don’t have time for much more than that.</p>

<p>So the failure rate is high, but in this case failing isn’t all that bad
an outcome.  In fact, most books that come home succeed on at least one
dimension.  Sometimes the books are so spectacularly awful or
inappropriate that they stretch your brain.  And often R’s favorite
books are not my favorites.  The bottom line is that we both get a fair
amount out of reading the mediocre bulk of our haul, even when most get
returned never to be read again.</p>

<p>Our latest keepers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Umbrella-Queen-Shirin-Bridges/dp/0060750405">The Umbrella Queen</a> (by Shirin Yim Bridges, illustrated by Taeeun
  Yoo) I have a special place in my heart for atypical stories
  that take place in other countries.  And even better, I
  like stories about kids who are true to themselves.  This book takes
  place in Thailand and follows a girl whose inner artist cannot
  be squashed.  It reminds me a lot of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Empty-Pot-Demi/dp/0805082271">The Empty Pot</a>(by
  Demi) and I Ioved
  that too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Library-Lion-Michelle-Knudsen/dp/076363784X">Library Lion</a> (by Michelle Knudsen, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes) The
  lesson here is fantastic: Rules are good, but there are always
  extenuating circumstances when they should be broken.  The premise is
  absurd (a friendly helpful lion hangs out at the library) but not
  totally drug-addled (see
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hogula-Dread-Night-Jean-Gralley/dp/0805071644/">Hogula: the Dread Pig of the Night</a> (by
  Jean Gralley) for an
  example of the latter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Worker-Kate-Banks/dp/0374400008">The Night Worker</a> (by Kate Banks, illustrated by Georg Hallensleben)
A respectful portrayal of a Latino engineer who takes a son to the job
site one night.  Lots of construction equipment and beautiful almost
Gauguin-style paintings.  What’s not to love?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Dragon-Kate-Banks/dp/B003IWYJIG">Max’s Dragon</a>by Kate Banks, illustrated by Boris Kulikov) This
story is about two (older?) brothers playing croquet and their quirky
(younger?) brother who has a big imagination and loves rhymes.
Super-cute and super-original and the art is good though not my
favorite style.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polar-Bear-Easy---Read-Puffin/dp/0140386920">A Polar Bear Can Swim</a> (by Harriet Ziefert, illustrated by Emily
Bolam) This book is designed for kids who are learning to read on
their own and who are curious about animals and science.  That’s a
perfect match for R.  It’s filled with fun facts (“A cow can drink 75
gallons of water in a day!”) and simple artwork.  I’m excited to check out
other members of the Viking Science Easy-to-Read series.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balloons-Dee-Lillegard/dp/0525459405">Balloons Balloons Balloons</a> (by Dee Lillegard, illustrated by
Bernadette Pons) I admit I find this book a little brain-numbing, but
R is going to love any book that has a rabbit in a hot air balloon
dumping huge numbers of multicolored balloons on a whole town.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-River-Marjorie-Kinnan-Rawlings/dp/1416911790">The Secret River</a> (by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, illustrated by Leo
and Diane Dillon) This book is special.  It was written in 1947 by the
author of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yearling-Aladdin-Classics-Marjorie-Rawlings/dp/0689846231">The Yearling</a>
and it follows a poor black girl who lives in the rural South in the
early part of the 20th century.  I don’t have a lot of experience with
this environment, but it sure seems real to me.  The art is great and
the story is magical in a way that works for adults and children.</p>

<p>Honorable mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ginger-Bear-Mini-Grey/dp/0375842535">Ginger Bear</a> (by Mini Grey) R and I both like the part where Horace
smears cookie dough all over the toilet seat, but it goes downhill
from there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Really-Rabbits-Virginia-L-Kroll/dp/157091897X">Really Rabbits</a> (by Virginia Kroll, illustrated by Philomena
O’Neill) Cute story about two pet rabbits who do household chores in
the middle of the night.  We could use these guys in our house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Classic-Read-Book/dp/0061885177">Wonder Woman: I am Wonder Woman</a> (by Eric K. Stein, illustrated by
Rick Farley) An adaptation of a comic book?  Really? Yes!  Wonder Woman is a
positive role model for girls and R loves her tiara and bracelets.
And it doesn’t hurt that Dad had a thing for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Carter#Wonder_Woman">Linda Carter</a>
when he was in high school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Tour-Jarrett-Krosoczka/dp/0375833439">Punk Farm On Tour</a> (by Jarrett J. Krosoczka) It’s really quite good,
but if you already have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Jarrett-J-Krosoczka/dp/0440417937">Punk Farm</a> you’re not getting a whole lot
more here.  If you don’t have <em>Punk Farm</em> yet, you need to run out and
get it right away!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tricycle-Elisa-Amado/dp/0888996144">Tricycle</a> (by Elisa Amado, illustrated by Alfonso Ruano) A girl from
a wealthy family in Guatemala is friends with three poor kids next
door.  She sees them steal her tricycle but doesn’t say anything to
her parents because she knows she shouldn’t have left it in the bushes
and she already has a lot more stuff than they have.  I love the complex
emotions and the interplay of personal relationships and the gulf
between rich and poor that exists pretty much everywhere but is
especially stark in Latin America.  All of this is lost on R, but
she’s 3.  I’m not so sure she’ll get it at 5 either, but I commend the
authors for trying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago the girls and I went to the
<a href="http://peabody.yale.edu/">Peabody Natural History Musem</a> and learned that salamanders
and newts are very common animals in Connecticut.  The reason you never
see them is that they mostly hang out in places we don’t go.  Reading a
little further, I learned that the best chance for an encounter is near
water on a rainy early spring night.  </p>

<p>Last week R and I were reading one of our favorite poetry books
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Boatman-Caldecott-Ribbon-Nonfiction/dp/0618135472">Song of the Water Boatman and Other Pond Poems</a>) and I noticed that
it said early spring nights were a great time to hear peepers—these
tiny tree frogs congregate around ponds and to attract mates with their
calls.  I’d never heard peepers, but it sounded pretty cool.</p>

<p>Then yesterday evening, when the weather forecast told me it was going to be
our last rainy night for at least a week, I decided R and I needed to take a
quick trip to the neighborhood pond.  We got our rain boots,
rain coats, umbrellas, and flash lights and hopped into the car.  “Are
you excited?” I asked?  “Oh yes, very excited!” R replied.</p>

<p>We arrived at the trail head and while the batteries in my big maglight
were almost dead, R’s flashlight saved the day.  We tromped along and
quickly heard our first peepers!  They got quieter as we approached the
pond, so we turned off our lights and only talked in whispers.  Within a
minute, a peeper on the other side resumed calling.  We both thought it
was fantastic.</p>

<p>On the way back to the car we looked for salamanders and newts but came
up empty.  We also learned that balancing on wet logs in the rain
wearing rubber boots is harder than it looks.  At home we did some quick
Easter egg coloring and got ready for bed.  R was super excited to when
Mom suggested she wear her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carters-Hearts-Fleece-Sleeper-Pajamas/dp/B00719YPJA">Peeper jammies</a>.  </p>

<p>The whole trip lasted 30 minutes, but our memories will last a lifetime.</p>
