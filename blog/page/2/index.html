  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to college in the late 1980’s, and <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">my school</a> was just close enough to NYC for the radio stations to play a lot of what was “hot” in the “hot” clubs in the city. And that was a Latin-infused pop dance music called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music">freestyle</a>. It was awesome:</p>

<!--- Noel, "Silent Morning"

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bzA6yO7BO10" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Sweet Sensation, "Hooked on You"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/psQfWUbEDEc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Stevie B, "Spring Love"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sFjoNhUrmU0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I even used my fake ID to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Sensation">Sweet Sensation</a> perform live in Albany. After graduation, I moved to DC where (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHFS_(historic)">Indie Rock was king</a>) and only heard freestyle driving through NYC on my way to and from Boston. The genre died out in NYC just a few years later.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Amazing dance music came into my life again in 2003 when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDLD">103.1 FM</a> in Los Angeles started calling itself KDL and playing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Hits">Dance Hits</a>.”  Instead of building on a Latin groove, they injected what seemed to me to be pure European pop trance directly into unsuspecting American ears.  </p>

<!--- Four Strings, "Take Me Away"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/faHomJimjLc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Junior Senior, "Move Your Feet"
--->
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SPlQpGeTbIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Sophie Ellis Baxtor, "Murder on the Dancefloor"
--->
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BsISfQAXE60" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I was obsessed and then devastated when KDL went off the air after less than a year.  And I wasn’t the only one–there’s a “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCF544CF9FE670FB5">KDL Resurrected</a>” YouTube playlist containing 133 videos that now has 1,607 views!  That number would likely be hundreds bigger if almost all the videos had not been removed due to copyright violations.</p>

<p>And so we come to today. I like Pink, and Maroon 5 and Katy Perry as much as anybody, but I’m ready for some fresh pop blood. In just the last two days I’ve heard these three super catchy and extremely danceable songs on the radio:</p>

<!--- Calvin Harris ft. Ellie Goulding, "I Need Your Love"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AtKZKl7Bgu0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Cobra Starship ft. Sabi, "You Make Me Feel"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HpyZEzrDf4c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!--- Capital Cities, "Safe and Sound"
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/47dtFZ8CFo8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lets all cross our fingers that this is just the beginning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-bike-and-shoes.jpg" title="[title &#34;R's bike and my shoes&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;R's bike and my shoes&#34;]" /></p>

<p>Several years ago my wife and I spent a week in Costa Rica during the rainy season. As expected, it rained most of our trip but was warm and fun nonetheless. And those brief windows when the sun came out were magical. I think raising kids is a little like this&ndash;mostly great, but some periods when all the stars align that are truly amazing. </p>

<p>When R was born, my exercise regime changed.  I stopped going to the gym or training for particular events, but I still managed to get out a couple times a week for a run and stay in reasonable shape. When B was born, planned exercise (i.e., beyond chasing kids and racing to work) disappeared as two kids is a bit more work than one and something had to give.</p>

<p>Some people are good at combining exercise with parenting.  They backpack with their kids and push them around with jogging strollers.  My kids don&rsquo;t like activities where they aren&rsquo;t active&ndash;they like pushing strollers more than sitting in them.  Also, sleep is like gold in our house and our kids sleep best in beds. I would never risk waking a sleeping child miles from home because I hit a pot hole.  I&rsquo;ve also seen other parents go bike riding with their kids.  These parents sometimes look like they are having fun, but they certainly aren&rsquo;t getting more exercise than if they were out for a leisurely stroll.</p>

<p>Last week, I entered a fantastic window in my parenting career where I can finally join the ranks of the co-exercising parents.  R is getting pretty comfortable on her bike and I&rsquo;ve been putting on my running shoes to run next to her on her rides. Yesterday she said she loved the feel of the wind in her face as she rode down a long hill. She calls the bike trail near our house &ldquo;the country&rdquo; even though it runs behind the local strip malls on one side, and the highway and an office park on the other.  To her credit, we also saw a ground hog cross the trail and watched ducks congregate in a little pond.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m terribly out of shape and she currently tires easily, but we&rsquo;re both getting better as she learns the fine arts of balance and pacing. It also helps that R and I have had a fair amount of one-on-one time as B&rsquo;s school started full-time last week but R&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be full-time until next week. Unfortunately, I think this window is destined to be brief.  R will eventually want to ride faster and longer than I want to run.  I don&rsquo;t know when that time will come, but it won&rsquo;t surprise me if it&rsquo;s soon given the current trend.  Every day she&rsquo;s substantially more comfortable on the bike and she loves speed.</p>

<p>Going on these bike rides has been incredibly fun and I&rsquo;m just trying to focus on the moment and appreciate them.  I&rsquo;m also already hoping to do it all again in a couple years with B.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a lot of my time creating and editing plain text files. It isn’t the prettiest or most powerful format for documents, but I still love it.  Plain text is trivial to copy and paste between applications, and the files are human readable.  Unlike .doc files, PDF files, or even RTF files, there are a gazillion apps that will show and edit text. And the format has staying power–it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">been around since the 1960’s</a> and I’m willing to bet it will be easy to work with in 20 years and maybe even 50 years. </p>

<p>Markdown is an extremely simple but incredibly powerful way to add a bit of formatting to plain text without losing any of plain text’s benefits.  When I write with Markdown, I can still use my favorite editing applications. At the same time, I can have section headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more.  Markdown does a lot of what HTML was originally designed to do but is much easier to write and much easier to read. It’s also easy to translate Markdown into any of these other formats when you need them. </p>

<p>My favorite thing about Markdown is that there is almost no learning curve–most people already use pieces of it without realizing it. If you want to <em>emphasize</em> a few <strong>words</strong>, you put <code>*one*</code> or <code>**two**</code> stars around them. If you want to make a bulleted list, you use stars for that too.  </p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>turns into this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>You nest lists by indenting them:</p>

<pre><code>* apples
	* Fuji
	* Braeburn
	* McIntosh
* bananas
* pears
</code></pre>

<p>to create this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apples
    <ul>
      <li>Fuji</li>
      <li>Braeburn</li>
      <li>McIntosh</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>

<p>Other stuff like marking headings with hashmarks or embedding links is straight-forward too. John Gruber invented Markdown in 2004 and the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">original spec</a> is still a great description of the language.</p>

<p>I use Markdown for tons of stuff.  This includes the notes that go along with every one of my lectures and presentations.  I can write them quickly and then have them display nicely on my iPad while I talk and walk around the room. I also take all my meeting notes in Markdown and sometimes share them with other meeting attendees. I write all my blog posts in Markdown and let Octopress/Jekyll automatically turn them into pretty HTML.</p>

<p>I don’t (yet) use Markdown for everything.  My research articles are mostly written in Latex which does a much better job with mathematical equations and big structured documents.  I use MS Word when I am collaborating with someone who is more comfortable in that environment. My class syllabi are still in Latex, but even though I could probably switch, it might be more trouble than it’s worth.  And while I often draft my slide content in Markdown, it almost always ends up in a set of PowerPoint slides where I have much greater control over the layout.</p>

<p>On the Mac, I use <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">emacs</a>  and <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a> to edit standalone Markdown files like blog posts and lecture notes.  I like emacs because I’ve been using it for 20 years and it’s really an extension of my brain at this point. It’s also what I use for editing code.  On the other hand, it’s kind of ugly.  FoldingText lets me hide/show sections of my document easily and makes my documents look pretty while I edit them by doing things like bolding text surrounded by double stars and hiding the actual double stars unless my cursor is on the bolded words.  It does the same sort of thing for links.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> on my Mac to edit and manage all my meeting notes and miscellaneous notes. When editing, it just shows the raw text, but I can always hold down the control key to see the pretty version of the text.  nvAlt is super-easy to search and it stores all the notes as separate files on dropbox so I can easily migrate to some other app if the mood strikes.</p>

<p>On my iPhone, I use <a href="http://writeup.prasannag.com">WriteUp</a> to edit standalone files like this blog post right now since it syncs so easily with Dropbox.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notesy-for-dropbox/id386095500?mt=8">Notesy</a> syncs perfectly with nvAlt on the Mac.  On the iPad, Writeup displays my lecture notes beautifully and gives me the option to make last minute edits.</p>

<p>If this post piques your interest, there’s great info about Markdown all over the web. Perhaps the single best resource is a <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">new book</a> by David Sparks and Eddie Smith that gathers a whole bunch of Markdown info in one place.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With just a few exceptions, no one likes exams.  Students don’t like the stress of taking the exams, instructors have to write the exams, and someone usually has to grade them. In-class exams don’t give enough time for testing very much material, and if the test is too long, it punishes students who know their stuff but are just a little slow. Take-home exams can cover more content, but it can be very tempting for students to cheat by getting help from friends or the Internet. Unfortunately, we need objective assessments of how much each student has mastered the course material, and right now exams are the best tool we have.</p>

<p>In an online class, exams are even trickier.  In my econometrics class this summer, we held our midterm and final exams in the virtual classroom.  At exam time, I emailed them a PDF with all the questions and my students wrote their answers on paper while my teaching assistant and I watched them through their webcams. We used pencil and paper because answering the questions required doing a fair amount of math and I wanted to see their work.  I didn’t want them to use valuable time slowly typing in symbols and equations. After two hours, they scanned their written answers (mostly with their phone cameras) and emailed them to me.  When I confirmed receipt and readability, the students were free to go.  </p>

<p>The process was easy and convenient, but had one major flaw: it would have been pretty easy to cheat. I say this believing in my heart that none of my students cheated and having absolutely no evidence to even make me suspicious.  Even so, any one of them could have forwarded the exam PDF to a friend (or professional) and had them email back their answers.  The incentives for doing so are actually quite strong: Yale classes are not cheap and they get real Yale credit for my online class. Not to mention the fact that most elite college students care a lot about their GPA.</p>

<p>A second problem we ran into was that students’ Internet connections were not always reliable.  When these connections dropped, some students didn’t even notice for a while and others had trouble reconnecting.  It wouldn’t have been fair to just disqualify those students, but again, it was a pretty huge opportunity to cheat. </p>

<p>We considered three alternative testing procedures, but I think only one would be a clear improvement over what we did.  First, we thought about requiring students to have a separate webcam that would let us view their computer screen.  In this scenario, they couldn’t use their computer for evil, but I still think it would be relatively easy for them to cheat with an alternative device outside the frame of view.  Second, we investigated using an online service that locks down their computer for only exam taking purposes. <a href="https://webassessor.com">Webassessor</a> provides this service along with online proctors, but it would also require good webcam placement.  And both of these alternatives are still reliant on continuous connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>The solution I like best is to use an in-person testing service where students go to a controlled physical location to take their exam.  <a href="https://www.prometric.com">Prometric</a> has more than 10,000 test taking centers all over the world–that means a huge fraction of the world’s population is within two hours drive of a center so it’s not all that inconvenient to travel to one one or two times during a course.</p>

<p>Timing is an issue for all these solutions–that is, you’d like all your students to take the exam simultaneously so the early students can’t share information with those that take the exam later.  If your students are scattered around the globe, at least some of them will have to take their exam in the middle of the night and that doesn’t seem fair.  My students in the far east had to take their exams at either 10pm or 11pm.  One way around this problem would be to have two versions of the exam–one for each half of the planet.</p>

<p>Next time I teach an online class where the stakes are high, I’m going to try to use a service like Prometric.  I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched a lot of Saturday Night Live in the 1990’s and one of my favorite recurring bits was <a href="http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com">Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey</a>. The soft music would come on, the gentle first sentence or two would scroll by and then BAM–the usually evil but always absurd gotcha at the end. Like a cross between a haiku and a fart.  I didn’t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Handey">Jack Handey</a> was a real person until a few days ago when he released his first novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Stench-Honolulu-Tropical-Adventure/dp/1455522384">The Stench of Honolulu</a>.</p>

<p>The book is about a guy with very few redeeming qualities who travels to Hawaii with his friend Dan in search of the legendary Golden Monkey. To be honest, the story reminds me of the road trips I took with a high school friend when we were in our early 20’s. We toured the American Southwest, Baja California and even the jungles and beaches of Taiwan. And we did bad things in all of these places. I’ve been trying to figure out which of us was Dan and which was the narrator. He was a little meaner (like the narrator) but he also did all the cooking and vehicle maintenance (like Dan). We were both idiots. It’s a tough call. </p>

<p>I listened to a big chunk of the audiobook at the supermarket last  weekend and got plenty of funny looks as I giggled and snorted my way through the aisles. Seriously, this was the funniest stuff I’ve heard in a long time.  But that doesn’t mean you’ll find it funny.  Plenty of Amazon reviewers say it’s just a big pile of potty jokes and they’re kind of right.  I mean, the main character wears his underwear on his head for half the story.  On the other hand it really does read like an amazing 240 page Deep Thought. If you have a low brow sense of humor but can also appreciate Sartres, this book is pure gold.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MOOC’s are Massive Open Online Courses and they are what everyone in higher education is talking about. These classes  are usually free, have huge enrollments, and per student are pretty cheap to run relative to a typical college class. The quality can be decent and MOOC’s open up access to higher education to literally billions of people around the world. MOOC’s also have the potential to decrease the cost of education for the millions of people that would normally attend a traditional in person college.</p>

<p>Yale currently allows anyone on the Internet to watch record lectures from many of its best classes through <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu">Yale Open Courses</a>, but with zero interactivity, the user experience is quite different from taking a “real” course.  Yale has also recently entered a relationship with Coursera, the leading MOOC provider, and plans to dip its foot in the MOOC pool this year with a few classes.</p>

<p>At the same time, Yale has been breaking new ground through its Summer Session online classes which aim to let students experience as close to an in-person class as you can get without being on campus. These classes mix recorded video lectures with the usual outside-class reading and problem sets and a live interactive video session with the professor and rest of the class.</p>

<p>It’s these live sessions that are really innovative for online learning.  When a student logs in, they see everyone else in the class including the professor in a virtual classroom.  Imagine a Google Hangout with up to 25 participants.  It requires everyone to have a decent internet connection, but when it works, it’s kind of amazing. </p>

<p>It would be impossible to scale up this type of course to “massive” numbers of students, but the idea is to maximize quality, not minimize price.  I call it a Small Closed Online Course, and while Yale started offering these online classes two summers ago, I’m in the middle of teaching my first one now.  It’s “Econometrics and Data Analysis” and it’s been a real learning experience for everyone so far.</p>

<p>Students can take the class from almost anywhere.  I have students logging in three times a week from China, Singapore, Madrid, Kentucky, Alberta, California, and even a couple from downtown New Haven, CT. They can watch the video lectures when it is convenient for them and they have the power to pause and replay parts that are not clear the first time through.</p>

<p>The live experience is a work in progress. I use it to do three substantive things.  First, I answer questions about the recorded material and the reading.  It seems clear that my students are not taking notes and writing down questions they cannot ask in the moment (as they would in an in-person class) because most days they don’t have any questions. It’s hard to know how if they are really engaging with the recorded lectures or if they have them on while they’re doing something else. For the past couple classes I’ve been asking them basic questions about the material to get a sense for how much is sinking in. I am thinking about requiring them to email questions before the live session begins.</p>

<p>The main thing I do in the live sessions is have my students work through problems together.  The software we are using (<a href="http://watchitoo.com">Watchitoo</a>) allows me to divide the class into groups and send them to sub-classrooms.  I visit each of the groups in turn and push them along when they get stuck. It’s classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipped classroom</a> stuff and it works well.</p>

<p>The third thing we do is discuss the material. I haven’t done much of this so far, but I have some future classes planned where we go over new applications of methods and talk in depth about specific points.  Most of Yale’s online classes thus far have been discussion-oriented (e.g., psychology or philosophy), but econometrics is much closer to a math class and thus not as good a match for discussions.</p>

<p>The technology has mostly worked well but has some real rough edges. Some students just don’t have strong enough internet connections and drop in and out during the live sessions. Moving between the sub-classrooms and the full classroom takes several more mouse clicks and time than I’d like. The whiteboard built into the live session software is too buggy to use, but we’ve had great success with a free HTML-based shared whiteboard (<a href="http://awwapp.com">awwapp.com</a>) I have the live session in one window on my laptop and my whiteboard in another window on my Wacom external monitor.  This lets me write with a real stylus and still see all my students.</p>

<p>One of the most successful parts of the class is my office hours.  I hold them in the same virtual classroom and use the same virtual whiteboard.  It’s almost identical to my in-person office hours.  Realtime access to an expert is the biggest difference between this class and a MOOC.</p>

<p>I’m getting a fair bit of feedback on how much they’re learning from their problem sets and the live sessions, but I miss being able to look into their eyes while I’m lecturing. We have our first exam this week, and I honestly don’t know how they are going to do.  My fingers are crossed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those readers who didn’t know why it was a big deal,
<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> was two really cool but
distinct things. First, it was a web site where you could specify a
large number of other web sites (aka “feeds”) that publish articles you
might want to read. It would then present those articles all together in
a neat list.  It would keep track of what was new, what you hadn’t read
yet, and what you’d already read. And it was far far more efficient than
going from site to site hitting refresh like a rat pressing a lever for
another hit of crack. This is especially true for people (like me) that
read a lot of sites that don’t publish very often or can go through long
dry spells.</p>

<p>I found the Google Reader web site kind of clunky and ugly, but you didn’t
actually have to ever visit it to experience the benefits. Google Reader
also provided a service so that third party apps could access the same
data and keep your subscriptions in sync if you used apps on different
PC’S or post-PC devices. This is what I used to do, and it was
fantastic. I would use the beautiful/fast/powerful
<a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> app on my phone, Mac, and iPad to browse
my feeds wherever I was. I even used the Google Reader website
occasionally.</p>

<p>And then Google announced they were shutting it all down on July 1.
Panic ensued, but the nerderati told us to be patient–they promised
even better alternatives would quickly blossom to take its place.  It
took a few months, but they were right. Unfortunately, I’ve had a busy
spring and summer and haven’t had the time to try them all to find the
best one.  Luckily, lots of other folks have invested their time
and I think there’s a decent consensus for a winner.</p>

<a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/06/feedle-dee-dee/">Dr. Drang</a>
have all settled on Feed Wrangler.  It’s a service that offers all the
features Google Reader did.  It costs $19.99 per year, but that’s a
small price to pay for stability.  With paying customers, they won’t
have nearly the temptation to just turn it off if they don’t feel like
running it anymore.  They won’t be shoving ads down our throat either
which I always felt was just around the corner with Google Reader.</p>

<p>Feed Wrangler has a web site for reading and also provides free client
apps for the iPhone and iPad.  The iPhone client has some serious
flaws. It’s definitely slower to sync new stuff than Reeder was. It
doesn’t support gestures to mark things read or unread.  And worst of
all, the default (unchangeable) font size is too small for me to read
unless I’m wearing my reading glasses. Thank goodness my old standby
Reeder will be supporting Feed Wrangler soon.  I don’t read much on my
iPad, but Mr. Reader already supports the Feed Wrangler service.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part about Feed Wrangler is the two things it does that
Google Reader never did.  Smart Streams let you define “collections” of
articles based on keywords and sources.  It’s much more powerful than a
folder and will let me sip from the high volume feeds that I would normally
stay away from. Filters are the opposite–you can define key words that
will cause an article to be automatically considered read and thus
ignored.  This way I can subscribe to the ESPN feed and never have to
read another story about hockey or NASCAR.  Bill Simmons’ <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmonsnfl2010/101105">ESPN
Outsider</a>
has arrived!</p>

<p>Google Reader is dead, but it was stagnant for years.  I’m legitimately excited about
a new era of innovation. Feed Wrangler has just won round one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I loved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books">Wizard of Oz</a> when I was a kid. Not the movie and not just the book, but the whole series of books and the whole world of Oz and the whole host of amazing characters. L. Frank Baum wrote 14 books and by the end of second grade I had read them all. The Scarecrow, the Patchwork Girl, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gump#The_Gump">the Gump</a>, the Cowardly Lion, and the Hungry Tiger (just to name a few) were some of my best friends. Given that my daughter R has a wild imagination and a voracious appetite for books, you can’t blame me for introducing  these stories as soon as possible. Actually, it was too soon.</p>

<p>We started reading a seriously condensed picture book version when she was about two years old. She thought it was terrific and for months all she wanted to do was to act out the story. She was Dorothy for Halloween last year, and right around R’s 4th birthday, we read a chapter of the unabridged <em>Wizard of Oz</em> every night. She loved it and even though it revved her up a little right before she was supposed to go to sleep, we finished it and dove right into the <em>Land of Oz</em>. Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse were as fun as the original characters and we zipped through <em>Ozma of Oz</em> where we got to meet our first Oz princess.</p>

<p>We hit a wall with <em>Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz</em>. The invisible bears were just too scary. That night it took a little longer than usual to get to sleep and the next night, R wanted to read something else. </p>

<p>Last weekend we had a similar experience.  As soon as it got warm enough, R has been zooming around on her pink Dora bike with training wheels. We would go as fast as we caould around the block and I would run down the hills to keep up with her. She was looking a little cramped and since the seat wouldn’t go up any higher, I thought it was time for a new bike. Our awesome local shop (<a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com">The Devil’s Gear</a>) had a used 16” bike that was perfect and we picked it up. It didn’t have training wheels and R said that was fine with her.</p>

<p>I also thought since B just turned two, she was ready for her first bike. We decided to pick up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MyKick-Balance-Bike-Cotton-Candy/dp/B009T2SITU">Burley MyKick</a>. It’s got two wheels and no pedals so you learn to balance right away. My friend Google tells me it’s easier to transition to a “real bike” from one of these than from a bike with training wheels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we did not have the fun-filled weekend of bike-riding that I was hoping for.  As soon as we got home, we learned  that both kids were too little for their new bikes. Seats only go so low. The only short term benefit was that R enjoyed racing the MyKick up and down the driveway.</p>

<p>This weekend things got a lot better. R decided she was ready to ride her new bike and this evening we did 4 laps around the block!  It didn’t take long for her to master the straight-aways up hill and down hill. But the seat is still too high and she needs support to start or stop. She’s going to be a menace to herself and our neighbors for a while yet.</p>

<p>Books and bikes are pretty low stakes things, and I don’t feel so bad starting them on the early side. We’ll return to Oz at some point. Our new bikes will be be there when the girls are totally ready. But some decisions are a lot harder to recover from if you make a mistake. Parents of kids who were born late in the year know where I’m going with this: When is the right time to start school?</p>

<p>I’m a December birthday and I started first grade when I was 5. My mom had to convince the principal to bend the rules since technically I was supposed to be 6 by September 1. Throughout elementary, middle school, and high school I was the youngest kid in the class. I was pretty emotionally immature. I had regular “accidents” until third grade. I always had trouble with girls and I think at least part of that was being younger than they were. And yet I feel strongly that it was the right decision for me. I was curious and intellectually ambitious and competitive. I would have been bored silly if I had been held back and even as it was, I wish I’d been challenged more. </p>

<p>I’ve also met lots of people with late in the year birthdays that were pushed into school early, and they’re bitter about it to this day. They really believe they would have had a more comfortable and successful school experience had their parents waited. And maybe their parents should have waited.</p>

<p>The trendy thing to do now is to wait. I swear it all started when Malcolm Gladwell’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922">Outliers</a> came out in 2008.  In the first chapter, he tells a story about how elite Canadian hockey players were all born in January or February. When these guys started playing, they were the biggest, most skilled kids on their age-graded teams and so were plucked out and given additional training/coaching. Maybe being the oldest kid in kindergarten or first grade helps with academics too. Maybe.</p>

<p>I strongly believe the “right” answer about when to start school depends on the kid (and the school). R was born in late November and will be starting kindergarten next year (before she turns 5). We will be watching her closely. The academic part of school will be no problem. She’s already got great reading and math skills and she loves to learn. On the social/emotional side, she acts her age. That might be hard when most of her friends are older. We are definitely open to having her repeat kindergarten at a new school. We’re also open to her moving on to first grade. We’re not open to doing something just because everyone else is doing it. We’ll make the decision based on her.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Yale, economics majors are required to take two “senior seminars” before they graduate.  These classes usually have 10-20 students and revolve around reading and discussing contemporary research in a specific area. After three years of mostly big lecture classes on theory and methods, seniors finally get a chance to apply what they’ve learned to a substantive topic.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I just finished my fourth year of teaching two of these seminars, and while that might not seem like very long, I have learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t work.  </p>

<h2 id="big-goals">Big Goals</h2>

<p>Every seminar should have both a substantive theme and a methodological theme.  In the fall I teach the Economics of Aging. We read papers on retirement, saving, elder care, and inheritance–if it’s economics and it affects older people, the topic is fair game. Most of the papers we read use structural microeconometric methods. The theory and estimation methods are serious–I still remember the shocked look a senior faculty member gave me when I told him we were reading <a href="http://gemini.econ.umd.edu/jrust/crest_lectures/rust_phelan.pdf">Rust and Phelan’s 1997 paper on Social Security, Medicare, and Retirement</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. In the spring, I teach the Economics of Human Capital in Latin America. The papers are mostly about the determinants of health and schooling in the region and most use reduced form program evaluation techniques. I teach just enough about difference-in-differences, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables so that my students can understand why an author chose a particular method and can interpret the results. By the end of the semester, my students can read a big chunk of the research literature that was previously inaccessible.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>I require my students to read two or three dense articles each week. I tell them they are hard and not to expect to understand everything immediately–these aren’t fluffy beach novels.  I encourage them to work at it and tell them I wouldn’t have assigned the articles if I didn’t they they were smart enough to figure them out.  To help them focus, students must fill out and submit a worksheet for each paper before we discuss it in class. Some articles (like surveys or policy reports) get special worksheets, but most worksheets contain these seven questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the research question? There may be more than one, but usually one is most important.</li>
  <li>What is the answer to the research question?</li>
  <li>Why is this paper important</li>
  <li>If there is an economic model, what is the behavior or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?</li>
  <li>What is the empirical approach?</li>
  <li>What data does the paper use?</li>
  <li>What didn’t you understand?</li>
</ol>

<p>The worksheets keep students thinking critically and constructively. The last question is most important to me as it tells me what I need to cover well during class time. The syllabus also suggests optional papers for most weeks in case students are particularly interested in a topic.</p>

<h2 id="student-presentations">Student Presentations</h2>

<p>Each week two or three students help me teach the class. They read the papers ahead of time and we meet to make sure they understand them well. These meetings are a pretty efficient way for me to review the week’s material and get to know my students. We usually plan short presentations on the papers that cover the basics quickly and some of the important technical parts that the rest of the class might have missed when they read the papers. Often the presentations contain new stuff from related or more recent papers to spur discussion. An easy way to put a class to sleep is to tell them things they already know.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The students then draft slides which I review the night before class. Again, it’s a great way for me to prepare and it means there is never a bad presentation.</p>

<p>During class, I interrupt the speakers often to offer alternative explanations of difficult points and ask the rest of the students questions. I try to do it in a constructive/respectful way–the goal is for everyone to be engaged and at least following along.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>After the presentations, I usually divide the class into small groups of 4-5 students each and give each group a job. Sometimes they will design a conditional cash transfer program for a particular context. Sometimes they will prepare for a debate on alternatives to social security. Sometimes they will make a list of the three most important questions in an area that remain unanswered. The key is that the students never know exactly what’s going to happen when they walk into the classroom. After the groups work for 15-20 minutes, we all talk about what they’ve come with as a big group.</p>

<p>Sometimes we don’t have time for any discussion because I’ve given a mini lecture about an econometric method that they need to know in order to do the reading for the next week. I’ll have a few questions for the class prepared, but mostly we proceed organically with an eye on the clock. </p>

<h2 id="papersprojects">Papers/Projects</h2>

<p>Most seminars require some sort of paper, but it’s often not well-defined and the instructor sees it for the first time when it’s passed in at the end of the semester.  That is very different from how it works in my seminars.  Each student works throughout the semester on a research proposal and gets lots of feedback from their peers and me during the process.  </p>

<p>At about week 3, they pass in a one page summary of their research idea. Before this, I try and give an overview of the topics we’ll cover during the semester. I also describe three or four successful proposals from earlier semesters. Their one-pagers are ungraded but I do tell them if I think they’re on the right track, give them ideas on how to refine their ideas, and point them to relevant literature.</p>

<p>They draft the front-end of the proposal in the middle of the semester. This builds on the research question and contains a literature review, a hypothesis, and an economic model. They’ve seen several models in papers and other classes by this point, but constructing one of your own to explain how a process works is a difficult but rewarding experience. I don’t expect them to formally prove any theorems based on their models–they can do that if they go to grad school.</p>

<p>Before they pass in their mid-term proposal, I spend a little class time explaining what I expect in the literature review and walk through the process of constructing an example model. I also hold three or four “work groups” outside class where 5-6 students and I talk through each student’s project. It’s more time-efficient than having one-on-one meetings and incredibly useful for the students to hear about and contribute to each other’s work.</p>

<p>I spend a fair bit of time giving constructive feedback on the midterm proposal. I give comparatively much less feedback on the final papers as most students don’t read those comments and even fewer will act on those comments. I expect every student to incorporate my mid-term feedback into their final paper.</p>

<p>We have another round of work group meetings near the end of the semester to talk about the last pieces of the final proposal: the empirical approach and the data. Here’s where they have to decide how to actually answer the question they posed at the beginning of the semester. The whole process exercises the creative part of their brain that is vastly under-used in most classes. </p>

<p>The important thing is not that the paper is a research proposal, though that works well for me. The key is that students actually work on it throughout the semester and get feedback along the way. </p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-advice">Miscellaneous Advice</h2>

<p>I believe one of the most valuable services I provide is just being available. Elite college professors are not typically great teachers. They are selected for their research skills and knowledge of the field. They should use this comparative advantage in their teaching by answering questions and talking about the state-of-the-art.  These classes are small–I am never overwhelmed answering questions after class or during office hours.  We aren’t talking about 300 person lectures where you could spend your life answering student email.  The bottom line is that most students really appreciate human contact.</p>

<p>I try to have a very open mind about improving the class and talk to other instructors about what works and doesn’t work for them.  I also take the last 15-20 minutes of the last class every semester getting direct feedback about what worked and what didn’t. Formal student evaluations are valuable, but they don’t allow for a conversation. I can throw out ideas and see what they think.  I can ask follow-up questions. Some students’ ideas spawn other students’ ideas. And every year, I learn new things that improve my class.</p>

<p>I refresh my classes at least a little bit every time I teach. I’ll dump the worst week. I’ll add papers I’ve come across over the last year that are interesting and relevant. I’ll try new exercises in class. And I’ll change what I expect from student presentations. It’s a lot easier to keep students excited when I’m excited.</p>

      <p>Juniors can take these classes if they meet the pre-requisites (at least two of intermediate micro, intermediate macro, and econometrics), but seniors get priority and the most popular seminars are full by the time juniors can register.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I dreamt I was at my high school reunion. Near the end of dinner, one of the organizers came to my table and asked if everyone who was gay would raise their hand because they were planning a separate meeting just for gay alumni. Six attendees from our table of 26 raised their hands. I had no idea about five of them, and while my first reaction was surprise, my second was pride in the social change that’s happened over the last 25 years.</p>

<p>In just the last year, we’ve had the first male American athlete in a major sport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Collins">Jason Collins</a>) come out with near universal acceptance. The number one draft pick in the WNBA draft (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner">Britney Griner</a>) mentioned she was gay and hardly anyone noticed. The Supreme Court seems on the verge of legalizing gay marriage (or at least banning the states from banning gay marriage).  And my (almost) alma mater<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Framingham High School, now has a club called the <a href="http://www.framingham.k12.ma.us/fhs_alliance.cfm">Gay/Straight Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>The reunion and the casual statements about sexual orientation by my old friends may have been a dream, but the reality is much better. Some of the healthiest and most loving couples I know are gay. Some of the best parents I know are gay. And it’s so nice that this is finally being recognized by a majority of Americans.</p>
