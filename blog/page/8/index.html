  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s become very trendy on tech blogs to not allow comments on articles.
And at least a couple of folks
(<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/">Matt Gemmell</a> and
<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/11/gemmell-comments/">Ben Brooks</a> have been
actively trying to convince other bloggers to turn off their comments too.  I
agree that if you’ve got a popular blog (and maybe a thin skin), turning
off comments can make your life easier.  I would even agree that on
popular blogs (and websites more generally) many (most?)  comments don’t
really further the discussion.  In fact, I read most of my blogs
(including Matt’s and Ben’s) inside
<a href="http://reederapp.com/">an RSS reader</a> and so I don’t even see any of
the comments that might or might not be there unless I click through to
the site itself.</p>

<p>But I have three objections to their position on comments.  First, when
you don’t get much traffic (I’m looking at you High Variance) and you
know most of the people reading your blog, it’s really nice to get as
much feedback as possible and I think comments are the best way to do
that.  If someone reading my article has something interesting to say
about it, the comment gives them an audience.  They can always email if
they want to say something privately,</p>

<p>Second, I often like to read what other people have to say about an
article (whether I’ve written it or not), even when I have to wade
through some less than insightful stuff.  Again, the signal-to-noise
ratio is particularly high in the early days of a blog when it’s mostly
friends reading, but even on a big messy site like
<a href="http://www.espn.com">espn.com</a> I think it’s fun to see the popular
reaction to a story.  And yes, I get it that the sample is not even
representative of the readership let alone the general population.  I
think <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is a terrific example of how
constructive (and entertaining) discussion of an issue can happen on the
web through comments.</p>

<p>Third, there’s this high horse attitude that if people have something to
say about an article, they should just write it up as an article on
their own blog.  And if the original author reads it and wants to
comment back, they will write another article on their blog.  I’m sorry,
but this just doesn’t happen.  I mean, I’ve seen blogs comment on other
blogs, but in almost every case the debate stops there.  And it’s
impossible for someone visiting the original site to see the
conversation at all.  And, believe it or not, there are people with
intelligent things to say that don’t have a blog.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll change my tune in the future when I’m drowning in haters and
forum-spam, but I have a feeling that’s going to be a while.  Until
then, comments will stay turned on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doug Almond has turned out an impressive amount of work in recent years
on how bad stuff that happens to fetuses early in pregnancy can cause
long-lasting problems. His first paper on this
(<a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/000282805774669943">AER 1985</a>)
showed that babies who were in utero during the 1918 American flu
pandemic “displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of
disability, lower income, and lower socioeconomic status.”</p>

<p>In the last year, he has produced two more papers in this area
(<a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.3.4.56">AEJ Applied 2011</a>,
<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w17713">NBER Working Paper 17713</a>) that
focus specifically on the long-term effects of the fasting of pregnant Muslim women
during Ramadan. And one of his co-authors (Reyn van Ewijk) has a
<a href="http://www.economists.nl/files/20111122-Long-termhealtheffectsonthenextgenerationofRamadanfastingduringpregnancy-forthcoming.pdf">forthcoming paper</a>
in the <em>Journal of Health Economics</em> on this topic as well. While none of the
papers is truly convincing on its own, taken together, the results are
striking. In Michigan, England, and Indonesia, Muslim babies who were in their
first trimester during Ramadan go on to experience worse health and
schooling outcomes than other babies.</p>

<p>What’s surprising about this finding is that the Koran specifically
states that pregnant women are exempt from fasting during Ramadan if the
health of their baby is at risk. Van Ewijk’s paper has a terrific
background section where he explains that in fact most pregnant Muslims
from around the world do tend to fast during Ramadan. There are three
main reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>differing beliefs about whether fasting is harmful to fetuses or
mothers,</li>
  <li>the requirement that any fasting that doesn’t happen during Ramadan
must be made up later, or</li>
  <li>an obligation to make up the fasting with a charitable donation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It certainly seems to me that as the results from these three papers
diffuse into the popular press, they could really affect mothers’ and
physicians’ beliefs.  That is, this research really could have pretty
direct positive effects on child health.  More research like this please!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An old friend of mine
(<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/">Philip Greenspun</a>) recently
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2011/12/31/election-prediction-barack-obama-wins-5149/">predicted</a> that Obama will win the 2012 presidency in a close election.
I agree, although for very different reasons.  He thinks that even
though the economy will remain poor, the American public won’t
put the blame entirely on Obama and that they will give him some credit for
ending the war in Iraq.  Phil has more confidence in the American people
than I do.</p>

<p>At this point, the Republican nomination seems to be a two man race
between Romney and Gingrich.  Gingrich is a lunatic and it’s hard to
imagine that even a majority of Republicans would vote for him.  I mean,
the guy left his first wife when she was recovering from cancer
surgery.  And more recently he converted to Catholicism and now panders to
the religious right.  Honestly though, it’s his willingness to just
throw the country into chaos (remember the Contract with America?) based on
whatever principles he happens to hold that day that scares the hell out
of me.</p>

<p>So I think Romney gets the nomination.  Right now, everyone knows him as a boring but competent business
guy who happens to be Mormon.  And Americans have a vague idea that
Mormons believe wacky things. But it’s going to become very clear very
quickly just how wacky that organization is.  Here are just a few of quirks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://i4m.com/think/intro/mormon-tithing.htm">Mandatory 10% tithing</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mormon-underwear.com/">Secret under-garments</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_race.htm">Institutionalized racism until 1978</a>.</li>
  <li>I almost forgot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_polygamy">“plural marriage”</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>And Romney’s been heavily involved as a church leader almost his whole life.  Christopher Hitchens
wrote a
<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/10/is_mormonism_a_cult_who_cares_it_s_their_weird_and_sinister_beli.html">great summary for Slate</a>
just a couple months before he died–that’s the sort of story we’re
going to see a lot of.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Under-Banner-Heaven-Story-Violent/dp/0385509510">Under the Banner of Heaven</a>
is going to start selling like hot cakes.  The story of Joseph Smith
and then Brigham Young is amazing, even without all the crazy polygamy
stuff.  </p>

<p>By he time the summer rolls around, the press is just going to drag the
Mormon church through the mud.  It’s going to be like watching a car
crash.  As someone who views religion as a great spectator sport, I can’t wait!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We do a lot of reading in my house and I don’t pay much attention to
age/reading levels.  R (who just turned three) likes books geared to her
own age as well as lots that are for older kids.  Most of the time, this
works out well.  She misses some nuance (e.g., the rich description of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Oz-Puffin-Classics/dp/0141321024">The Wizard of Oz</a>)
and sometimes the main point (e.g., the literalness of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amelia-Bedelia-Collection-Read-Book/dp/0060542381">Amelia Bedelia</a>),
but she’s almost always entertained.  And I think she gets a lot out of
pushing the envelope.  The best examples of this are science and nature
books.  We’ve been reading the Pooh Encyclopedias
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-First-Encylopedia-Winnie-Friends/dp/0786834064">Nature</a>
and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-First-Encylopedia-Winnie-Friends/dp/0786834080">Animals</a>)
and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chickens-Arent-Only-World-Nature/dp/0698117786">Chickens Aren’t the Only Ones</a>
for months and she’s learned a ton.</p>

<p>The place where we get in trouble is when we read books for older kids with bad
behavior.  I don’t mean where the main characters are having fun and
they do bad stuff like jumping on the bed (like those damn
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Five-Little-Monkeys-Jumping-Along/dp/0618732764">monkeys</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skippyjon-Jones-Judy-Schachner/dp/0142404039">Skippyjon Jones</a>)
even though these are also inspiring in the wrong way.  I mean those
books that try to teach kids to behave by showing them how not to
behave.  The prototypical example is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Berenstain-Bears-Too-Much-Teasing/dp/0679877061">Berenstein Bears and Too Much Teasing</a>
which we read over Thanksgiving.  What we learned is that saying “Nah
nah na nah nah” and calling your father “Flub-a-dub” are hilarious.  The
novelty wore off fast (for me, not her).  When we read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Friends-Frances-Read-Book/dp/0060838035">Best Friends for Frances</a> we learned
that doing things with No Boys Allowed is fun.  When we read
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Dinosaurs-Play-Their-Friends/dp/B001VF5I1Y">How do Dinosaurs Play with Their Friends?</a> we learned to hog up toys
and say “Mine!” and when we read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Dinosaurs-Say-Goodnight/dp/0590316818">How do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?</a> we
learned to demand even more stories than usual before bed.  R learned
that fighting (and making up) with your friends is fun from the otherwise truly wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Busy-Day-Gyo-Fujikawa/dp/1402768192">Oh What a Busy Day</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the only case I can think of where the authors actually pull
off this trick is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Friend-Friends-Families/dp/0316111538">How to Be a Friend</a>
which is a remarkably great manual from which most adults would learn a
thing or two.  R has yet to copy the bad stuff and is on the edge of her seat
throughout.  It even gets a lot of requests (i.e., “Excuse me, will you
read this?”)</p>

<p>The lesson we’ve learned in our house is to recognize and quarantine
these books as fast as possible and hope we remember to bring them out
again when the girls are ready.  Of course, we’ll probably be reading
them to R as her younger sister A listens in and then goes and jumps on her bed!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was growing up, my mom and I had a whole set of holiday rituals
starting on December 1 with several paper advent calendars.  They only
had cute little pictures behind the doors, but I loved them.  Every
December 6, my mom would wake me wearing a crown of lit candles on her
head to celebrate Santa Lucia’s Day.  The tree went up about a week
before Christmas and on Christmas Eve we would always eat three small
fish sandwiches which she swore was a Swedish tradition.  Not that we
have an ounce of Swedish blood in us.  Christmas morning played out like
it did in most houses with stockings and presents and then piling in the
car to go to a relative’s home.</p>

<p>Then it all came to screeching halt for like 20 years as I would always
travel on Christmas and most years didn’t even bother putting up a tree.
It was a little sad, but without kids, it was fine.  I would parachute
into someone else’s family (sometimes even my own) and skim on the
surface of their traditions for a few days before flying back to my own
decidedly non-Christmasy world.</p>

<p>All that’s changed since the girls showed up.  Last year we hosted
Christmas with one daughter, and now we’re in a new house with two
girls.  We even have a mantle for stockings and a chimney for Santa.
R is 3 this year and she’s pretty excited about the idea of bounding
down the stairs on Christmas morning to see what presents have arrived
and if Santa ate his cookies and drank his milk.  We have a hand-me-down
train running around our tree and a whole family of advent elves hanging
from the stairs.  I’m super-excited to read <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>
to the girls ON the night before Christmas.</p>

<p>It’s hard to underestimate how good it feels to be building our own
Christmas family traditions, and I’m looking forward to fine-tuning the
process for years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sure there are hundreds (if not thousands) of articles on the web
about why one should (or shouldn’t) blog, but I think this is a very
personal question.  For me, the first (but not the only) reason is that
I want to consume less and create more.  Of course, blogging is
something I’ve thought about for a long time and
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Chris-Wake/Hidden-habits-of-ineffective-people">this article</a> was the straw that filled the camel’s stomach.</p>

<p>I also feel the only way to write better and more comfortably is to
write, and blogging is a natural and fun form of writing.  I think it
lends itself to the 15-30 minute chunks that I’m planning to invest.  I
tried Twitter a few months ago as way to scratch my blogging itch and
the experience confirmed for me that tweeting isn’t writing. Even my
tiny attention span is too long for Twitter.</p>

<p>But these two goals could have been accomplished with a personal
journal.  That didn’t feel right either, because I also aspire to
providing entertaining, useful, and inspiring content, though achieving
just one or two of these at a time is probably a more achievable goal.
Having an audience also has perks: It’s a great incentive to not put out
junk.  You don’t even need an audience to get this benefit–just a
potential audience.  I’m also looking forward to hearing occasional
feedback on stuff I write.</p>

<p>So what’s on the horizon?  To be honest, this might be one of those
projects I start that fizzles almost immediately.  I almost named this
Ghost Blog in honor of that possibility.  But instead, I went with a
more optimistically descriptive title because I have eclectic plans for
this space.  And while this is most definitely not a purely professional
blog, I don’t plan to write anything that will prevent me from holding
elected office.</p>
