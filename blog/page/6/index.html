  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-siracusa-2016.jpg" alt="Siracusa 2016" /></p>

<p>Fellow Americans, our country has come a long way in the last 50 years. We have had our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">Catholic president</a>, our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">African-American president</a>, and almost our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Mormon president</a>. In a few generations we will almost certainly have our first gay president. I say the time has come for our first geek president and John Siracusa is the perfect<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> person for the job.</p>

<p>For those of you who have never heard of him, Mr. Siracusa is a software developer by day and an ace gamer, devoted father, loving husband, and nerd celebrity by night. He’s most known for his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/">tour-de-force</a> reviews of (Mac) OS X and more recently for his wide-ranging soapbox podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a>.  It is these venues where Mr. Siracusa has demonstrated he has the skills our country needs.</p>

<p>He is the ultimate natural analyst, able to glance at anything and quickly identify its strengths and (especially) weaknesses. While he typically applies his super-power to tech products<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, it will be amazing to see him use it to intelligently dissect and choose among potential public policies.  </p>

<p>Mr. Siracusa is also blessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_thing">big picture vision</a>, a critical requirement for a successful chief executive.  He can tell you about the future of <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/31">computing</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/63">software distribution</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/1">TV</a>, and even <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/18">toasters</a>. His ideas about using <a href="http://the-magazine.org/2/strange-game">artificial worlds as petri dishes for social policy</a> are exciting and promising (if not <a href="http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/articles/126.pdf">completely original</a>). Once he throws off the corporation-imposed shackles banning political discourse that bound him on Hypercritical, I am certain we will see a beautiful clear vision for the future of America and indeed the planet. </p>

<p>Mr. Siracusa has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">integrity</a>, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp">humility</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal">moral compass</a> that the American public wants in a president but is so often lacking. He has a warm heart and is unafraid to defend unpopular groups–nerds, cosplaying-wanna-be-nerds, homosexuals, and trans-sexuals are all welcome in <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/96">his big tent</a>.  He’s a humble every-man who is able to <a href="http://vimeo.com/46369728">make fun of himself</a> and his election season cameos on Saturaday Night Live will surely be hilarious. While a presidential campaign always brings out the muck rackers, I’d be shocked if they unearthed any Siracusa scandals.</p>

<p>December 28, 2012 was a sad day as the <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/100">final Hypercritical episode</a> was recorded, but think about it this way: John Siracusa now has a big hole in his schedule to fill.  America needs him!</p>

      <p>OK, he’s not <em>perfect</em>. I don’t know if he’s ever left the country so maybe he’d have to brush up on foreign policy.  And sure, he has no executive experience and eschews management jobs.  And he doesn’t like risk.  But <em>no one</em> is perfect.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hv-trains.jpg" alt="Fisher-Price Geotrax…and a few fairies…OK, a lot of fairies" /></p>

<p>When I was a kid, a big part of the Christmas season was visiting my grandmother and immediately racing down to her basement to run the trains around the track.  I loved the big styrofoam mountain, the rumbling of the engine on the metal tracks, and the feeling of industrial omnipotence when holding the controls in my hand.  </p>

<p>Now that I have my own kids, I want them to have fun with trains during the holidays too.  But my kids are little and a big <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lionel-Pennsylvania-Flyer-Freight-Train/dp/B004L3IKQI">Lionel rig</a> isn’t good match yet.  Traditional train sets are expensive, delicate, and a ton of work to set up.  And I don’t feel good about having toddlers poking around in the miles of requisite electric wiring.</p>

<p>Last year my brother and sister-in-law sent us their old <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/brands/geotrax/index.html">Fisher Price Geotrax</a> and it’s absolutely perfect for kids under six years old.  The exact set we inherited is no longer for sale, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-GeoTrax-Control-Timbertown-Railway/dp/B001W1YG56">Timbertown Railway</a> is pretty close.  Ours is made up of a whole bunch of snap-and-go plastic tracks and includes bridges, a windmill, and even a station that will load packages onto your train.  The engine is battery-operated and makes a pleasant chug-chug noise, while the remote control is big, wireless, and easy for small hands to operate.  It looks good, is super-easy to put together,  and happily chugs around our tree.    We have enough track to try out several configurations and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-GeoTrax-Train-Rail/dp/B000NW2D4Q">expansion packs</a> are just an Amazon one-click away.</p>

<p>Another great thing about the set is that it’s seemingly  indestructible.  It’s been stepped on, kicked, and disassembled (by kids and adults) numerous times and nothing’s ever actually broken.  You can’t even forget to turn it off and run down the batteries because it stops automatically after ten minutes of non-interaction.</p>

<p>Bottom line: We all love it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started this blog, I chose a platform that would give me a site that looked fine out of the box so I could concentrate on the writing.  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> fit this requirement and even provided several nice features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built-in search</li>
  <li>Organization with tags so visitors could easily find articles by category</li>
  <li>Easy integration with Disqus comments</li>
  <li>Built-in <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Reference-Shelf/Libraries/RSS-Library/What-Is-RSS.shtml">RSS feed</a> for those who want to subscribe</li>
  <li>Automatic announcement of new articles to Facebook</li>
  <li>Easy integration with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> (for traffic statistics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, a year later, I have more of a vision for what I want to do with the site and I’m ready to tinker a bit. Unfortunately, while there’s some flexibility in how a Tumblr site looks, but they don’t give you any real control. Ever since high school I’ve spent regular chunks of time writing code and bending computers to my will. I’ve done this as a professional software developer, as a research economist, and often just messing around. The last year has been less geeky than usual as I’ve concentrated on teaching and less technical research projects.  It’s time to scratch my nerd itch.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen to switch to a particularly nerdy blog platform (<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>) that requires using command-line tools, but it has the huge benefit of total control. Octopress is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme">Jekyll</a> which is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and I can tweek it as much as I’d like. I’ve always wanted to learn Ruby and reading and modifying other other people’s code is a great way to learn a language.</p>

<p>In addition to Octopress/Jekyll/Ruby, this project gets me up to speed on several other modern nerdy technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install all sorts of open source software including the latest version of Ruby.</li>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> is what version control will look like for years to come–it’s fast, collaborative, distributed, and flexible.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is where all the coolest open source projects live these days.  Any new software I write that I want to share will go here.    </li>
  <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a powerful layer on top of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allows for powerful adaptive layout of HTML pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Octopress is in part an excuse to fiddle with new tech, it also feels very comfortable as articles are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>–a very lightweight text-based markup language that I lately find myself using for almost everything.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s New?</h2>

<p>On the surface, the site shouldn’t look all that different, but beyond the engine being replaced, there are several subtle changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A real <a href="http://highvariance.net/about.html">About</a> page</li>
  <li>Links up top for the main categories I tend to write about</li>
  <li>A search bar near the top of every page</li>
  <li>Quick links to my recent posts and my favorite posts.</li>
  <li>Much better layout for mobile devices</li>
  <li>Super-fast rendering since Octopress generates the whole site as static HTML which just sits on the server</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="was-it-easy-to-migrate-from-tumblr">Was it Easy to Migrate from Tumblr?</h2>

<p>Two things helped a lot: The Octopress documentation is excellent and I already had all the articles on my local machine in Markdown. The only thing that was tricky was backwards compatibility as I wanted all my old URL’s to work and all my discussions to transfer over.  I used the <a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">alias-generator</a> plugin and a little elbow grease to make all my Tumblr URL’s redirect to my new URL’s.   </p>

<p>Disqus (the service that keeps track of comments) says they will crawl your new site and use any redirects it provides to update their database.  Unfortunately, while <em>browsers</em> can understand the redirects that the alias-generator creates<sup id="fnref:fn_ag"><a href="#fn:fn_ag" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> just fine, the <em>disqus crawler</em> does not.  So I had to create a csv file that mapped all the old URL’s to the new ones and upload that.</p>

<p>Announcements of new articles on Facebook are now handled by <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.  It will likely take a little fine-tuning to get these right.</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-the-horizon">What’s on the Horizon?</h2>

<p>The primary emphasis of this site remains the text, but I do want to integrate a little more media–even just a few pictures here and there would be nice. I want the category pages to have their own looks. Beyond that, all I know is that I’ve now got the power to do anything.  Should be fun!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:fn_ag">
      <p>Since the site is static, it can’t actually send HTTP
301 permanent redirects. Instead, the alias-generator creates HTML stub files for all the old URL’s with http-equiv meta tags containing the new locations of the URLs.<a href="#fnref:fn_ag" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our neighborhood is so awesome. For the last three years (at least) on the evening before Halloween nearly all the kids gather for the Pumpkin Parade.  Everyone wears their costumes and brings their carved pumpkins in a wagon or a stroller and we all proceed to march around the block.  Afterward we have hot cider and cookies and catch up with our friends.</p>

<p>This summer a new neighbor hosted the world’s greatest barbecue block party.  There was terrific turnout and highlights included a hammock filled with up to 10 little girls at any given moment, a sunshine piñata, and a giant cannoli.  The party gave birth to an email list which spawned a Facebook group which then led to last week’s first annual neighborhood Christmas caroling.  We are positively swimming in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0743203046">social capital</a>!</p>

<p>About 40 kids and grown ups arrived at Cathy and John’s house at 5:45 for cookies and hot cocoa and some warm up songs. R especially enjoyed belting out The Twelve Days of Christmas as she had been practicing it over dinner all week. Then we all walked and sang along the Pumpkin Parade route and finished with even more cookies and cocoa.</p>

<p>In the interests of making a super-fun event even better next year, I’ve done some thinking and I’ve got some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Plan on singing a lot of songs.  We had a printout of about 7 that didn’t last long enough and folks weren’t ready to repeat them after the first round.  And very few people knew more than the first verse of even the most popular carols.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggest that folks download a caroling app that has lyrics.  I think the best one is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sing-along-to-50+-christmas/id481902746?mt=8">Sing Along to 50+ Christmas Carols</a> but it’s $4.99 which might be more than most folks (not me!) want to spend.  It’s got the music and big fonts and karaoke style moving lyrics.  A cheaper option is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/christmas-carols/id296111618?mt=8">Christmas Carols</a> for 99 cents that has they lyrics for more than 100 songs but no fancy graphics.  The best part about having an app is that it only requires one hand–you don’t need a hand for the lyric printout and another for the flashlight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have someone in front that sets a slow pace.  Our group quickly spread out such that the back couldn’t hear what the front was singing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put up signs so everyone in the neighborhood knows it’s happening.  One of the best parts of the experience was when families would come out on their stoops to listen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick a charity and collect money for it along the way. This might make some people uncomfortable, but I think it would be worth it.  Certainly to the folks who would receive the donations  would appreciate it and this seems like a great opportunity to exercise (not exorcise) the Christmas spirit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Merry Christmas everyone!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first time I saw the World Wide Web, I was hunched over an 8 lb laptop using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">text based browser</a> and a 56k modem. There wasn’t much to see and it didn’t seem like a big deal. Then about three month’s later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a> (the first graphical browser) was released and I “got it.” Within a week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaviSoft">we</a> redefined our product line and turned a generic set of “network publishing” tools into a web server and a web authoring tool.  Within a year we were purchased by America Online to show that they “got” the web too. My point is that I’ve been deeply embedded in the web for a long time.  </p>

<p>And yet, not including my professional <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dm529">web-based resume/cv</a>, I didn’t have my own website until exactly a year ago when High Variance was <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/14573237390/first-post">born</a>. I’m not sure why it took me so long to get here, but after a year of any project, I think it’s important to step back and take stock to see if the original goals are being met. I had three:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create more:</strong>  As expected, the topics have been eclectic ranging from economic policy to kid book reviews to eighties pop music.  The rate of production has been similarly irregular with a burst of activity last January (17 posts) and a summer hiatus.  But the aggregate rate has been about one post per week.  I’m happy with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learn to write better and more comfortably:</strong> Perhaps my biggest surprise is how enjoyable the whole process has been. I don’t get anxious when I write here and my anxiety level when writing professionally has definitely decreased.  When my mind is spinning about a topic, writing about it actually gets me to calm down and figure out what I actually think about it.  As for the quality of the writing, I think I’m getting better, but it’s hard to tell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide entertaining, useful, and/or inspiring content:</strong> My audience will need to be the judge of this, but I know I’ve given at least a few chuckles, a few bits of helpful advice, and even tugged on a few heartstrings.  And in looking back on what I’ve written, much of the content seems to have aged well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose I should also say something about my readership. According to Google Analytics, over the past year I’ve have 2,070 unique visitors (5.7 per day) and 4,000 page views (11 per day). Not much, but if you squint at the chart, it does look like traffic is trending slightly up.  There are even a few posts that get regular search engine traffic–<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18591130112/why-are-zebras-so-mean-and-horses-so-nice">zebras</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/23166850855/pdf-annotation-on-the-ipad-in-2012">pdf annotation on the iPad</a>, and <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16047390011/mincer-1958">Mincer 1958</a> are the top three.</p>

<p>As I was about to blow out the candles on my birthday cake a few weeks ago I realized something very special: I didn’t have anything new to wish for.  I have a wonderful wife and two lovely children.  We’re all healthy and happy with our jobs and our house.  I just want what I already have.  That’s kind of true of this blog too.  So here’s to another fun and fulfilling year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about conflict and sharing lately. First because we watch this Sesame Street video almost every night with the girls:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl3e-OUnavQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In case you’re video-averse and don’t want to watch the whole hilarious two minutes and seven seconds, Robin Williams and the two-headed monster “introduce” children to the word <em>conflict</em>. I put “introduce” in quotes because this is a concept with which every child older than 6 months is already intimately familiar. Some kids might use different terms–“fighting!” is quite popular in our house–but the concept is clear. The video also shows the two-headed monster doing something that’s a little less natural for kids: sharing. </p>

<p>Second, my blog-friend<sup id="fnref:fn_blogfriend"><a href="#fn:fn_blogfriend" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Chris Blattman <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2012/12/13/where-property-rights-really-come-from/">wrote</a> recently about how they handle sharing at his daughter’s daycare. In a nutshell, they don’t push it and instead focus on developing a child’s sense of ownership.  The idea is that when kids realize that their stuff won’t be rudely ripped away when friends express interest, they will start sharing voluntarily. </p>

<p>but mostly interact with through their blog. It makes for awkward conversations as you always feel closer to them than they feel to you.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest reason I’ve been thinking about this subject is the conflict and relatively smaller amount of sharing that happens at home with the girls (4 yrs and ~18 months).  We have developed our own fairly complex tri-partite system of communal rights, partial rights, and exclusive rights.  Most of the toys are communal property–there is no “mine” for these. When one kid is playing with a toy in this category and the other kid wants in, we try to get them to say “Can I have a turn?” and then enforce a reasonably short time limit. </p>

<p>A smaller group of toys have owners (e.g., birthday presents) but still must be shared. These often come in groups (like fairies or ponies) where it’s fun to play with the whole group, but neither kid owns the whole group. Dividing ownership in this way provides incentives to play together–if you share your own stuff, you get access to your sibling’s stuff too. This arrangement is also designed to break down R’s hoarding tendencies.</p>

<p>The last category is the smallest: pure property rights.  R has a plush pony and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Toy-Amelia-Groovy-Girl/dp/B0077LGIEM">groovy girl</a> in this group and her sister has a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Monster-Plush-Bowling/dp/B000GL1DTA">6 small plush monsters</a>.  The girls are certainly allowed to share these (R rarely does) but sharing is never required. Occasionally one girl will pick up the other’s toy, but when owner notices and demands it back, it’s always given up immediately.</p>

<p>Our system isn’t perfect and may in fact be more complicated than the girls’ little brains can handle. My bet is that if we reduced the number of categories, we would also reduce the amount of conflict. But I’m not sure what category(ies) would go. I don’t want to assign an owner to every toy–that would be miserable to keep track of and wouldn’t promote a cooperative spirit.  I like that they maintain some ownership of presents that they’ve received individually.  And the most extreme group is where we see the least amount of conflict–the last thing I want is <em>more</em> fighting!  So we’re going to keep the system we’ve got and hope that the kids are learning about both property rights and cooperation.  Check back in twenty years to see if it worked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The eighties are not known as a time of soul bearing honesty (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">Iran-Contra</a>), but
eighties music is full of cheesy earnestness about love in its various
messy forms.  Eighties singers told the hard truths even when it made
them look weak.  Here are four great examples of eighties guys who
weren’t afraid to play the victim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abYzI9ycjk">Everything She Wants</a> (by
Wham, 1984): George Michael is having a rough time with a no-good
money-grubbing girlfriend.  I smile every time he finds out
she’s pregnant and says “If my best isn’t good enough, how can it be
good enough for two?  I can’t work any harder than I do!” Maybe this was
the incident that turned him off women forever?  Not that there’s
anything wrong with that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu788foYCa8">I’ve Done Everything For You</a>
(Rick Springfield, 1981): Based on my analysis of his catalog, this
guy seems like he was just a bad boyfriend.  He lusted after his friend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs">Jessie’s girl</a>.  He told his girl not to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp42V938eBA">talk to strangers</a>.  And here
he says “I’ve done everything for you; you’ve done nothing for me!”
At least he was <a href="http://ztams.com/index.php?action=display&amp;ref=26342">good looking</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0">Don’t You Want Me?</a>(by
The Human League, 1981) This is another case of a guy who did
everything–“I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around”
and she’s got the nerve to dump him.  What’s unique in this song is that she
gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZW1C3neao">The Rain</a> (by Oran Juice
Jones, 1986): Here’s where we see that eighties male victimhood
crossed race lines.  The best part of the song is when we listen in on Mr. Jones
confronting his cheating girlfriend and telling her “You gotta get on
outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, punch-bucket-shoe-wearing
crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2012-12-08T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 8<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc">MOOC</a> is an acroynm for Massive Open Online Course.  It’s a trendy name
for packing up a course’s content (video lectures, problem sets, exams,
a mechanism for peer interactions, etc.) and making it available to a large
number of students over the internet without requiring significant live instructor input.
It’s that last part that allows the system to scale and separates the
idea from simple distance learning or a traditional online course.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about MOOC’s is the expansion in availability of
university-level content.  At least three groups of top-tier
universities in the US (<a href="http://www.edx.org">edX</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.org">Udacity</a>) are
actively producing these kinds of online courses and making them
available for free to anyone.  It means that kids and
adults from rural China to urban Brazil can watch and learn from the
some of the best professors in the world and interact with each other
about the material.</p>

<p>A second exciting thing about MOOC’s is that they promise to be a major
disruptive innovation for existing institutions of higher education.
Think about what happens in an average traditional college course.  The
professor stands up and gives a lecture taking occasional questions from
the class. He/she assigns reading and homework and gives exams. They are
somewhat available to answer questions in office hours or by email. A
MOOC isn’t better on every dimension, but I believe they’ve recently crossed a
line and the overall experience is actually better than the average
college course.  </p>

<p>As students become aware of MOOC’s, I think a few will decide to forego
college and instead learn what they want to learn more cheaply and on
their own schedule.  Most students (and their future employers) however
will want a credential (degree) that “proves” they have mastered a set
of material.  It’s only a matter of time before the big three (or
someone new) comes along and is able to provide this.  Online degrees
exist today and I predict they will become more and more
mainstream.<sup id="fnref:fn_dating"><a href="#fn:fn_dating" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  That said, the current college experience is more than
courses and I think the market for that won’t be going away soon.  </p>

<p>Students will also start demanding more of classes at existing
universities and attending colleges that raise their game and start
providing higher quality in-class experiences.  That means colleges will
have to leverage what they have that the MOOC’s will never have: live
instructors/experts that are able to spend time either one-on-one or in
small groups with students answering questions and having real time
conversations. This is possible online, but it doesn’t scale up to
massive numbers of students per instructor.  Some faculty will start
building on MOOC content–that is, they will replace their own lectures
with those of the MOOC’s and add their own interactivity.  And I’m happy
to say that the he big live lecture will go the way of the horse and
buggy–average professors just won’t be able to compete with the top
professors in the world and their video lectures.</p>

<p>I was going to title this post “The Revolution’s Coming” but the
revolution is already here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like Paul Krugman a lot–we’re both liberals and believe strongly in
the value of big government and thougtful regulation.  Unfortunately, he
sometimes has strong opinions about things he hasn’t thought through.
That’s my only explanation for his <a href="">recent article</a> on the “cruelty” of
raising the Social Security retirement age–a policy I think is smart on
almost every dimension.  </p>

<p>The Social Security system was designed after the Great Depression to do
two things: keep old people out of poverty and insure against disability
that prevents people from working to support themselves.  The disability
insurance part of Social Security is less well-known than its retirement
benefits but is very important and I have nothing to say about it today.
You’ll note that I didn’t mention a third objective: funding a long
retirement for most people after they’ve worked a sufficient number of
years.  The Social Security system is expected to provide this now, but
it certainly wasn’t at the beginning.</p>

<p>In 1930, the average white 20 year old male could be expected to live to
age 66 (<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html">source</a>).  If he
made it to age 40, he could expect to live to age 69, and if he made it
to age 50, his expected age of death increased to about 72 years.  During
the bulk of the years he contributed to Social Security, he was
expecting a fairly short (1 to 7 year) period after age 65 when he could
actually retire with full benefits.  Even FDR didn’t see the goal as
funding people’s “golden years”:</p>

<pre><code>"We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against
one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we
have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection
to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job
and against poverty-ridden old age."

-- President Roosevelt upon signing Social Security Act ([source](http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html))
</code></pre>

<p>Contrast this with the experiences of people in 2004 (the latest year I
could easily find data). A 20 year old expected to live to 77 years, a
40 year old to 78 years, and a 50 year old to 79 years.  The expected
duration of retirement ranged from 12 to 14 years.  Krugman is right
that the expected length of retirement upon reaching age 65 has not
changed all <em>that</em> much
(<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/basicfact.htm">from 14 years to almost 20 years</a>),
but that’s irrelevant to people’s expectations during working life.</p>

<p>Other things have changed since the Social Security was enacted too.
While original benefits were high enough to keep retirees out of
poverty, modern levels replace a much larger fraction of income.  Jobs
are a lot less physically demanding today.  In 1940, 26.7% of those
employed worked on farms or did miscellaneous forms of physical labor
relative to just 5.9% in 1990.  And in 1940, only 21.3% of workers were
managers, officials, clerical workers, or professionals.  This ballooned
to more than half the work force by 1990.  (More detailed breakdowns
<a href="http://www.demographicchartbook.com/Chartbook/images/figures/fig16-1.pdf">here</a>).
Finally, I’m pretty sure physical health of those who do survive to 65
is better now than it has been in the past though I couldn’t easily find
data to back that up.</p>

<p>Most people who reach 65<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are strongly enouraged by the incentives in
the Social Security system to retire even though they are perfectly
capable of being highly productive members of the work force.  I believe
their experience is a huge untapped resource for the economy.  But what
of the people that Krugman is worried about: Those who worked physically
stressful jobs for years and at age 65 don’t expect to live all that
much longer.  I have a heart and I worry about this group too.  Suppose
we let people retire at age 65 but capped their benefits at a relatively
low level.  This constraint would be unbinding for those who worked low
paying (and more likely physically demanding) jobs.  At the same time,
it would encourage relatively wealthier (and healthier) folks to work
until they were, say, 70 years old.  If wealthier people really want to
retire earlier, they can save more during their working lives and rely
on Social Security for what it was designed: insurance against poverty
in old age.  We all win!</p>

<p>benefits at 62 and higher benefits if they wait until the “full
retirement age” of 65.  The amounts are designed to make the people
fairly indifferent between the two dates.  In the next few years, the
full retirement age will be going up to age 67 (details
<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/agereduction.htm">here</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a week before Halloween, R and I raided the library’s selection of
Halloween-appropriate picture books.  I’ve felt
<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/21370720836/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-2">guilty before</a>
about skimming the cream but hopefully sharing what we learned
will balance out the karma.  Before I start, I know what you’re
thinking: “It’s the middle of November!  Who cares about Halloween?  How about sharing something useful
like the top 10 Thanksgiving picture books?”  Don’t worry, that’ll be
here before Christmas.  In the meantime, bookmark this page and put a
note on your calendar to check back on October 15, 2013 and then head to
your local library.  On with the show!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklins-Halloween-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590693301">Franklin’s Halloween</a>
(by Paulette Bourgeois, illustrated by Brenda Clark) Franklin is one
of my favorite recurring lovable-yet-flawed characters.  He’s just a
regular kid (turtle) who usually gets in some sort of minor trouble
and learns from his mistakes.  He’s kind of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">messy</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Plays-Game-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590226312">not very athletic</a>,
and has even been known to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Fibs-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590446479">tell a fib or two</a>.  In this book, he just
has fun making his own Halloween costume and going to a party.
There’s a great spooky twist at the end and he’s even generous to a
sick friend.  Hurray for Franklin!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brooms-Are-Flying-Michael-Rex/dp/0312380151">Brooms Are for Flying</a> (by Michael Rex) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humbug-Witch-Lorna-Balian/dp/159572009X">Humbug Witch</a> (by
Lorna Bailin) Spoiler Alert!  These two books are simple and cute.
One is about a witch who turns out to be a girl at the end and the
other is about a girl who turns out to be a witch at the end!  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WITCH-WHO-LIVES-DOWN-HALL/dp/B000J4MU7I">The Witch Who Lives Down the Hall</a> (by Donna Guthrie, illustrated
by Amy Schwartz) The mostly black and white illustrations (with
touches of orange) are a great complement to a story about a boy who
lives down the hall from a “strange” lady and her black cat.  He’s
convinced she’s a witch.  Clever and funny to both kids and adults.
Reminded me a lot of <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18359444436/kid-book-review-monster-edition">Mrs. Muffly’s Monster</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Halloween-Night-James-Stevenson/dp/0688099327">That Terrible Halloween Night</a>
  (by James Stevenson) This is about as scary as you can get and still
  be appropriate for a three year-old. I loved it and R is still talking
  about it.  Last night she told me our basement floor was covered with
  frogs!  I liked the pen and pastel comic book layout too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cake-Girl-David-Lucas/dp/B003NHR9OM">Cake Girl</a> (by David Lucas) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Lucas/e/B001HMTVBY">David Lucas</a> is so good–all his books
have such sweet characters, surreal stories, and pretty
illustrations.  This one is about a witch who learns about friendship.</p>
