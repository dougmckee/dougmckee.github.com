  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend Julian is a pretty nice guy.  He’s generous with his time and
tolerant of most social behavior.  He honors his commitments and is
honest in his communication.  But at the same time, he chooses not to
participate in the US democratic government by voting.  For those of us
who see voting as a moral obligation, this is somewhat disturbing.
Julian recently posted a
<a href="http://tunesforbears.com/2012/01/19/no-really-i-dont-vote/">clear statement of why</a>
on <a href="http://tunesforbears.com">his blog</a> (which makes for a good read in general
BTW).  Since he is economic theorist by training, he makes his argument
by laying out a fairly standard economic model of voting and pointing
out how it is perfectly rational for him to vote and many other people
not to.</p>

<p>In Julian’s model, people benefit from voting in two ways: the (slight)
chance they will personally influence the election and the “warm glow”
(WG) they get from the experience.  If the sum of these outweigh the
costs of missing work and traveling to the polling place, then people
will vote.  Julian justifies his personal decision by saying that most
other people must get a warmer feeling inside when they vote since the
chance of any one person changing the election is tiny.  As
models go, this one is pretty empty (as Julian admits) since so much of
the action happens in WG and it says nothing about where WG comes from.</p>

<p>I think utilitarian models are great for describing behavior, but lousy
for defining what behavior is right or wrong.  Just because someone
might find stealing to be individually rational if their chances of
being caught are low, that doesn’t make it right.  Before I go on, I
want to be perfectly clear that I don’t know anything about
philosophy–I couldn’t even make much sense of this
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Beginners-Writers-Readers-Documentary/dp/086316157X">comic book guide to philosphy</a>
when I read it a few years ago.  That said, Julian’s description of
Kant’s categorical imperative really spoke to me.  In his (Julian’s)
words, “citizens are morally obligated to vote if they prefer a world in
which others do”.  I translate this to mean “it’s immoral to free-ride
on other people’s voting behavior”.  This is a statement <em>outside</em> the
model about behavior that may or may not be rational <em>inside</em> the model.
Julian justifies his own action in this context by saying he wants
everyone to act as he would act <em>conditional on the WG they happen to
feel</em>.</p>

<p>If Kant were here, I think he would say that WG is BS and that people
don’t decide whether or not to vote in order to maximize their
utility–they decide between right and wrong.  I vote because I want
to live in a world where everyone (or at least the informed folks vote),
not because it makes me feel warmer than it does Julian.  To be more
precise, I think WG is almost homogeneously distributed and some people
are moral and some are immoral free-riders.</p>

<p>Of course, my statement about Julian being an upstanding moral guy in
the rest of his life still holds.  :) I just think he’s putting too much
faith in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics">the first theorem of welfare economics</a>.
Just because there are some (many?) situations where individually
rational behavior leads to a socially optimal outcome doesn’t mean all
situations are like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jacob Mincer’s 1958 paper in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>,
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1827422">“Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution”</a>,
is one of the most well-cited in economics–304 times according to
<a href="http://apps.isiknowledge.com">Web of Science</a>.  And yet, I would be
shocked if more than half the people who’ve cited the paper have even
opened it and read the first page.  The reason it’s cited so often is that Mincer
did indeed write down the famed Mincer equation here, but he
wasn’t the first to notice that log wages are an approximately linear
function of years of education.  What’s special about this paper is that
Mincer was the first person to write down a simple utility-maximizing
model from which you can derive such an equation.</p>

<p>Wages are not normally distributed.  The lower half of the distribution
is all clustered together, but the high end is really spread out.  And
all those
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street">one percenters</a> at the
high end are making far more than average wages.  But physical
dimensions like height, head circumference, and forearm length <em>are</em>
normally distributed.  And though it’s a lot harder to measure, most
scholars believe that cognitive ability is normally distributed too. In
the early part of the twentieth century, this was seen as something of a
paradox–if physical and cognitive ability are the major determinants of
productivity then shouldn’t wages (which measure productivity) also be
normally distributed? </p>

<p>The average gain in wages that comes from an additional year of schooling
increases with the amount of schooling someone has.  Expected wages go
up by more for the 16th year of schooling than the 12th year of
schooling.  One of Mincer’s insights was that a big part of the
non-normality of the wage distribution is a direct consequence of these
non-linear returns to schooling.</p>

<p>Mincer had great intuition.  He recognized that a person must eventually
be compensated for wages they could have earned during the years they
attend school.  The more schooling you already have, the more you need
to be compensated for getting an additional year of schooling.  Mincer
shows that in his model, wages must increase multiplicatively for each
year and that is exactly what happens when the log wage is a linear
function of years of education.  In the data, wages are generally
associated with about a 15 <em>percent</em> increase for each year of
schooling.</p>

<p>Academic economists worship at the altar of the new and technically
sophisticated.  This means the vast majority of econ papers written
before the 1980’s just languish on library shelves.  And even though
it’s true that most of these older papers aren’t terribly relevant, I
think Mincer (1958) is just one of several diamonds in the rough.  I’m
always on the look out for more, and would welcome any suggestions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I’m not the first to notice that these two musical acts have a
few things in common, but I bet the similarities go deeper than
you think.</p>

<h2 id="the-obvious">The Obvious</h2>

<p>Both groups were young, attractive, and British.  In the beginning, they
played catchy simple pop songs and were incredibly successful.  Both
also made fun movies about the band running around getting in trouble
and playing music (“A Hard Day’s Night” and “Spice World”).</p>

<h2 id="the-members">The Members</h2>

<p>The Beatles and the Spice Girls both had nicknames and you can even kind
of match them up together.  Paul was the Cute baby-faced one–kind of
like Baby Spice.  George was the Quiet one–kind of like Posh Spice.  It
starts to break down with Ringo (the Funny one), but we’ll give that to
Sporty.  And then there’s John (the Smart one) with no obvious
counterpart.  Ginger Spice left the band (was kicked out??) early on,
just like Pete Best, and both events inspired the anger of many loyal
fans.  I remember reading about “Pete is Best” signs and chants when I
was a kid.  But then It turned out that Pete and Ginger <em>were</em> each the
least talented of the bunch–I’ve tried several times to like Ginger’s
(Geri Halliwell’s) solo efforts, but they sound awful even to me.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-fact">After the fact</h2>

<p>Looking back, both groups had short but intense careers–the Beatles
showed up in the early 1960’s and were gone by 1970 and The Spice Girls
released all three of their albums between 1996 and 2000.  But after
their breakups, every single member went on to release solo albums.
Paul McCartney and Emma (Baby Spice) Bunton both produced great work,
while John’s brilliant solo career was cut short by tragedy.  Victoria
Beckham (Posh) also started a promising solo career with her terrific
self-titled album (featuring “Not Such an Innocent Girl”), but bowed out
of the music business too soon to concentrate on her family with David
Beckham.  And though most of the solo albums had their bright spots, the
whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts for both bands.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest similarity is that even many years after their
primes, both bands are still widely considered the best ever of their
respective genres.  Sure, manufactured-girl-band-pop is less
important than rock and roll, but even so, the Spice Girls
deserve some respect!  Girl Power!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google’s greatest power is ubiquity.  Almost everyone uses
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for search.
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google</a> has become the standard place
people store their RSS subscription information.  And
<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> seems like it’s almost
there too.  That means if you run a small group that has events, you
should strongly consider putting together a Google Calendar for it that
members can subscribe to.  That way the group events can plop right down
into the calendar that many members already refer to every day.  Classes
and weekly seminars are a perfect match.</p>

<p>It’s surprisingly easy and I’m doing it with both my classes this
semester.  Here’s what my TA and I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new calendar making sure to check the “Make This Calendar
Public” box.</li>
  <li>Add all the lectures (with weekly topics), exams, and paper due dates as
separate events.</li>
  <li>Go to Calendar Settings for the calendar and click on ICAL next to
Calendar Address to get a link for it.</li>
  <li>Email the group and tell them all to bring up Google Calendar, scroll
down to Other Calendars, and click on the little triangle next to it.
Then they should select Add By URL and paste in the link that popped up
at the end of Step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re deep into our first winter in the new house and are just now
figuring out how to properly control the indoor temperature.  On the
plus side, we’ve got the ingredients of a fabulous heating system.  The
brand-new
<a href="http://www.buderus.us/products/gasheating/gasconventionalboilers/loganog234x.html">gas-fired boiler</a>
is <em>so</em> much cheaper and cleaner than the oil-fueled relic that was here
when we moved in.  The house was built in the 1920’s and has one
or two huge radiators in every room.  We even have a
programmable thermostat (a Lux TX500B which is nearly identical to the
current <a href="http://www.luxproducts.com/thermostats/tx500e.php">Lux TX500E</a>)
so we can lower the temperature during the day when we’re at work and at
night when we’re in bed.</p>

<p>For the last couple months, the thermostat would turn on the boiler at
6:00 am and keep it on until the house reached 68 F.  The problem was
that even though the boiler turned off, the radiators were still full of
hot water and they would continue heating the house driving the
temperature up to 71 or 72 and driving me kind of crazy.  The same thing
would happen in the afternoon when we got home from work.</p>

<p>My first thought was that there must be a setting on the thermostat to
account for what I’m calling “radiator heat momentum”.  There isn’t.
The closest you can get is to lower the minimum amount of time the
boiler is on and that doesn’t actually help in most situations.  My
second thought was that this was a great excuse to get a
<a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest</a>–it’s the only thermostat anyone has ever
described as sexy, but as far as I can tell, its AI smarts are all about
saving you 10 minutes of programming.  This is especially true if you
have a pretty rigid schedule.  And it has no special knowledge of
radiators.  Oh well.</p>

<p>The solution we’ve settled on is imperfect, but  good and easy to
implement with some semi-creative thermostat programming.</p>

<p>WEEKDAYS: In the morning, we simply set the thermostat to go to 66 and
the temperature drifts up to where we want it after the boiler turns
off.  During the day, the house goes down to 62 and at 4:30 pm, the
thermostat goes back to 67.  The temperature drifts up a little higher
than we’d like, but we don’t want it to drop below 67 before we go to
bed and we can only have 4 different temperature settings per day. (Yes,
I think this restriction is ridiculous.)</p>

<p>WEEKENDS: At 6:00 am, the thermostat jumps to 66 and drifts up to about
68 within the hour.  At 7:00 am, the thermostat goes to 68 and that
keeps the house from getting too cold during the day when we are around.  We also set the
Swing on the thermostat to 0.25 degrees; this means the boiler turns on
fairly often for short periods of time but these little firings during the
day don’t generate much momentum–it’s really just the big push in the
morning and in the afternoon during the week that cause a problem.  It’s
possible we could raise the Swing and be a little more efficient and
still not generate much heat momentum.</p>

<p>I’m don’t know why other folks aren’t complaining about this (since
radiator heat isn’t <em>that</em> rare) and why the thermostats don’t handle it
more transparently.  My best guess is that less than mammoth radiators
don’t hold their heat as well and so it’s just not an issue in houses
with average radiators.  Either that or the solution I’ve come up with
is so obvious that no one feels the need to talk about it.  My ego tells
me it’s the former so I’m going with that.</p>

<p>These three videos are objectively hilarious.  I was going to write a
pithy insightful post about the humor found in the juxtaposition of the
contemporary and the mundane with one of the most evil and destructive
dictators of all time. It turns out I’m a little late to the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having someone I respect validate a choice I’ve made always gives me a
warm feeling inside.  In
<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/10/humidifiers">a recent post</a>,
<a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> discusses and recommends
humidifiers. The upshot is that evaporative humidifiers work best, but I
wanted throw my four cents in.</p>

<p>First, steam humidifers are pretty dangerous around small children.  The
last thing I want is an inviting vat of hot water falling off the dresser and
boiling my girls.  Of course I can only find perfectly safe (though
not very effective)
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Gallon-Humidifier-Hello-Kitty/dp/B000MR4IX6">ultrasonic Hello Kitty humidifers</a>
on the web, so it’s not a huge crisis.</p>

<p>Second, we have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-QuietCare-Cool-Moisture-Humidifier-3-Gallon/dp/B0002UXDRA">Honeywell HCM-630</a> 3 gallon cool moisture humidifier in
our bedroom.  It’s now $60 on Amazon, but it was $30 when we bought it 4
years ago.  We end up refilling it almost every day and it does a pretty
good job on a relatively small room with the door open.  But the air
coming out is cold enough that we have to be careful that it doesn’t
blow too close to the baby’s sleep area.</p>

<p>Third, we don’t use the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002TSA8S/?tag=marcoorg-20">liquid additive</a>
that Marco recommends, but we do use
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ProTec-PC-1-Humidifier-Cleaning-Cartridge/dp/B000FKJRDG/ref=pd_sim_k_5">these cleaning cartridges</a>.
They definitely work, but I bet Marco’s solution ends up being cheaper.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s really important to run the thing every day or the filter
dries out and gets very gross very fast.</p>

provocative and if you care about teaching, especially at the university
level, I encourage you to watch it.  I agree with most of what he’s
saying and try to incorporate a lot of his ideas in my own classes.  But
he’s just wrong about a few things.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae is unhappy with the state of schools in America–he says
they “suck” for a variety of reasons, but the main one is that they are
full of big impersonal lecture classes where the teacher/professor
stands at the front and pontificates while the students sit there
and take notes (best case) or update their Facebook status (worst case).</p>

<p>I don’t think lecture classes have to be all that bad–I had some very
good ones when I was an undergrad science major at
<a href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer</a> in the mid 1980’s.  At the time (and maybe
still) the institution took a lot of pride in it’s teaching.  Big physics
and chemistry lectures were full of very entertaining and illuminating
experiments and I definitely learned in that environment.  The
main problem with this set up is that it isn’t optimal–there are much
better ways to teach when the professor and students are in close
proximity.  I actually think the days of the big lecture are numbered as
there are several places people can go to get free high quality
impersonal video lectures on the internet.  You may have heard of
<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a>,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/">iTunes U</a>, and
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT’s Open Courseware</a>.  I was very happy
to see one of Yale’s very best economics professors on the front page of
<a href="http://www.academicearth.org/">Academic Earth</a> earlier this week.
<a href="http://www.academicearth.org/courses/game-theory">Ben Polak’s game theory class</a>
is legendary here, and now anyone on earth can experience it (as a
non-interactive lecture) for free.  The point is that if you’re paying
gobs of money for an in-person university education, you deserve better
than that.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae goes on to say that university teaching is bad because schools
don’t hire great teachers–they hire and promote based on research. He’s
exactly right about this.  Not only is teaching ability ignored
during hiring, all the incentives for tenure track faculty are to spend
as little time as possible on teaching.  You just have to keep your
enrollments and student evaluations above pretty low thresholds.  I
don’t see how universities can improve without changing these hiring
practices and incentives.</p>

<p>As an aside, he’s pretty critical of the certification process that’s
required for getting most secondary school jobs.  In order to teach
science at the high school level, I think you should not only know a lot
about science, you should also know how to teach.  The certification
process (flawed as it is) is supposed to make sure you do.  I bet
Dr. Tae would be an amazing high school science teacher, but I’m not so
sure about all of his Northwestern physics faculty colleagues.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae hates grades; he calls them “coercive”–he feels that teachers
make students think the way they want them to think by holding grades
over their head.  I’ll concede that there are better ways to motivate
students to work hard than grades, but at the end of the day, the grade
is how someone who wasn’t in the classroom (like a prospective employer
or admissions committee) can judge what you learned in that classroom.
It provides information that’s just not readily apparent in an
interview.  So I’m not ready to just throw out grades all together.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae loves for kids (even adult kids) to ask questions and do
experiments to answer them.  I agree this is a great way to learn and
stay excited about science.  It’s also true that having a strong base of
knowledge (be that facts or methods) is important and that means
students have to read and listen to stuff they might think is boring in
the moment.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae is exactly right when he says the secret to learning is to “Work
your ass off until you figure it out”.  Failure is far more common than
success in science and learning.  So often I have students who come to
me and say “I read the article for today and didn’t understand it.
Something is terribly wrong!”  No it’s not.  Learning is hard.  Reading
science, doing math, writing well, making an argument, they all take
serious effort.  None of it is supposed to be like reading a newspaper
article or watching tv.  It’s totally normal to have to read something
several times to get it.</p>

<p>Dr. Tae talks a bunch about how fundamentally broken our schools are
with their bad teachers and semester-long courses and grades.  But then
he says there are a lot of ways we can “polish the turd”.  He’s right about
this too.  My students ask their own questions, work in small groups,
and spend big chunks of time one-on-one with me.  I reward curiosity,
creativity, and hard work in my grading.  Many of them continue research
they started in my classes after the semester is over.  My bet is that
all this is true of Dr. Tae’s classes when he teaches physics.</p>

<p>Before you throw out schools as currently conceived, you have to be
ready to replace them with something better.  Here’s where I think
Dr. Tae’s train goes off the rails.  His ideas about “distributed
teaching” are totally crazy.  He seems to think that we should all teach
what we know part-time and all together, this will give people a better
educational experience than they would get in college.  He gives
Wikipedia as an example.  I love Wikipedia, but reading about a topic
there is a far cry from taking a course on it with someone who has spent
their life studying it.</p>

<p>Like so many things, it all comes down to incentives.  Knowledge is a
public good, but someone has to produce it and communicate it.  That’s
not free.  A system that depends on people volunteering their time is a
system that produces an extremely sub-optimal amount of knowledge.
There’s probably a role for government in subsidizing this production,
and I think this a great argument for not
<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/21271">dismantling our public universities</a>.
But I do think there’s vast room for improvement to the education
system.  In the meantime I’ll continue to polish turds in my own
classes.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/D6VUfJxIBlk">Shazam LyricPlay on Youtube</a>]</p>

<p>This morning I had a real WOW moment with my iPhone.  I was in the car
listening to the radio and a super-catchy song I’d never heard before
comes on.  (If you must know, it was
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPTlhBmwRg">Maroon 5’s Moves Like Jagger</a>–I
have no shame) I quickly break out my phone, and Shazam it.  That means
I started the Shazam app and jammed my finger on the center of the
screen so it would start listening to the song.  While it tried to match
the song to one in it’s vast database-in-the-cloud, I tossed my phone
onto the passenger seat–I was supposed to be 100\% focused on driving
the car after all.  A few moments later I glance over to see if Shazam
had figured it out and it was scrolling the lyrics of the song playing!
In time with the music!  And nice and big and appropriate for singing
along!  Turns out that if what you Shazam is one of their 30,000
LyricPlay-enabled songs, you just flip your phone sideways and you
suddenly have a pocket-sized Karaoke machine.  Awesome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hair metal is weird. It showed up big in the mid eighties with Mötley Crüe
and Ratt and then was gone by the early nineties. It was full of macho
lyrics (Shout at the Devil, Wanted Man, Lick it Up, Rock of Ages,…),
big guitar solos, leather, and head-banging. It definitely wasn’t real
metal, but it had the aroma of metal.  But then on top of all this testosterone,
hair  featured tons of make up, songs about partying, and strangest
of all, a power ballad on almost every album.  Why? I can think of four
possible explanations:</p>

<p><strong>1. Sensititivy?</strong> Did every hair band have a singer/song-writer who had to
 let the world see his soft emotional side on a regular basis?  Did they
 really need to express their love so sticky sweetly and publically?
 Based on my analysis of band behavior and song lyrics, I think probably
 not.  “Home Sweet Home” (Motley Crue) and “Closer to My Heart”by (Ratt)
 are unarguably the best of genre.  The first is widely interpreted as
 being about how the song-writer (Nicki Sixx or Tommy Lee) is on tour
 but really misses being back at home with his girlfriend/wife:</p>

<pre> 
    You know I'm a dreamer
    But my heart's of gold
    I had to run away high
    So, I wouldn't come home low
</pre>

<p>But those guys were so well-known for drunken debauchery on tour that their
 sincerity here is hard to believe.  Ratt took a more honest tack:</p>

<pre>
    When you cross the line, then you'll find
    That you're one step closer to my heart
    Closer to my heart
    One step closer to my heart
    Closer to my heart
</pre>

<p>I’m not exactly sure where Ratt draws their line, but I am sure I don’t
want to know.  It ain’t holding hands.  These are not the words of
sensitive men.</p>

<p><strong>2. Rest?</strong> Hair bands expend a lot of energy jumping around during their
 live shows and it gets tiring.  With all the partying back stage and on
 the tour bus, these guys aren’t in great shape either.  Maybe they
 perform these slow songs so they can take a breath and get their energy
 back?  If that were the case, how do the real metal bands do it?  Judas
 Priest and Iron Maiden could crank through whole sets with no ballad
 breaks.  That’s where the guitar solo, drum solo, and even bass solo
 help out.  And the hair bands took advantage of these too.</p>

<p><strong>3. Economics?</strong> Now we’re getting somewhere.  The non-ballad songs on every
 hair band album all appealled primarily to a young male demographic.
 So when I wanted to hear Ratt’s “Lay it Down “ or Dangerous but Worth the
 Risk”, I had to buy <em>Invasion of Your Privacy</em>.  No one bought (or
 downloaded) singles in the eighties.  When Ratt added “Closer to My
 Heart” to the album, they suddenly doubled (or more than doubled) the
 number of people who might buy the album.  It was a brilliant example
 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling">product bundling</a>.
 The most extreme example of this was when tons of people bought
 Extreme’s Pornograffitti because they loved the ballad “More than
 Words” and were shocked to find it wasn’t so representative of the
 tracks on the album.  I used to see tons of these cd’s in the used bins
 in the early nineties.</p>

<p><strong>4. Girls?</strong> I went to a lot of metal and hair metal shows back in the day
and the crowds couldn’t have been more different.  There were actual
girls at the hair shows!  I’m not saying they didn’t like the heavier
music, but I know the ballads were a big draw.  And the bands were
pretty happy about this too.  A good friend of mine went to a show where
Winger was the opening act (Remember “She’s only Seventeen”?) and he saw
the lead singer walking around in the venue after his set was over.  My
friend went and asked him for an autograph and was told “Get out of here
kid, I’m looking for chicks.”  So the ballads worked out well for them,
but I’m not sure they were smart enough to see this fringe benefit ahead
of time.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, I think the power ballad was a side effect of
the record industry economcs of the time.  We shouldn’t be sad that the
hair metal power ballad is gone though.  We should be happy that it existed at all!</p>

<p>If all this talk has got you excited to listen to a few, here is my
personal top seven:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Closer To My Heart” <em>Ratt</em></li>
  <li>“Alone Again” <em>Docken</em></li>
  <li>“Nobody’s Fool” <em>Cinderella</em></li>
  <li>“Tears Are Falling” <em>Kiss</em></li>
  <li>“Bringin’ On the Heartbreak” <em>Def Leppard</em></li>
  <li>“Still Loving You” <em>Scorpions</em></li>
  <li>“Home Sweet Home” <em>Mötley Crüe</em></li>
</ol>
