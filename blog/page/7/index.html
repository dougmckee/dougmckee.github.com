  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a lot of my time creating and editing plain text files. It isn’t the prettiest or most powerful format for documents, but I still love it.  Plain text is trivial to copy and paste between applications, and the files are human readable.  Unlike .doc files, PDF files, or even RTF files, there are a gazillion apps that will show and edit text. And the format has staying power–it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">been around since the 1960’s</a> and I’m willing to bet it will be easy to work with in 20 years and maybe even 50 years. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I watched a lot of Saturday Night Live in the 1990’s and one of my favorite recurring bits was <a href="http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com">Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey</a>. The soft music would come on, the gentle first sentence or two would scroll by and then BAM–the usually evil but always absurd gotcha at the end. Like a cross between a haiku and a fart.  I didn’t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Handey">Jack Handey</a> was a real person until a few days ago when he released his first novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Stench-Honolulu-Tropical-Adventure/dp/1455522384">The Stench of Honolulu</a>.</p>

<p>The book is about a guy with very few redeeming qualities who travels to Hawaii with his friend Dan in search of the legendary Golden Monkey. To be honest, the story reminds me of the road trips I took with a high school friend when we were in our early 20’s. We toured the American Southwest, Baja California and even the jungles and beaches of Taiwan. And we did bad things in all of these places. I’ve been trying to figure out which of us was Dan and which was the narrator. He was a little meaner (like the narrator) but he also did all the cooking and vehicle maintenance (like Dan). We were both idiots. It’s a tough call. </p>

<p>I listened to a big chunk of the audiobook at the supermarket last  weekend and got plenty of funny looks as I giggled and snorted my way through the aisles. Seriously, this was the funniest stuff I’ve heard in a long time.  But that doesn’t mean you’ll find it funny.  Plenty of Amazon reviewers say it’s just a big pile of potty jokes and they’re kind of right.  I mean, the main character wears his underwear on his head for half the story.  On the other hand it really does read like an amazing 240 page Deep Thought. If you have a low brow sense of humor but can also appreciate Sartres, this book is pure gold.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those readers who didn’t know why it was a big deal,
<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> was two really cool but
distinct things. First, it was a web site where you could specify a
large number of other web sites (aka “feeds”) that publish articles you
might want to read. It would then present those articles all together in
a neat list.  It would keep track of what was new, what you hadn’t read
yet, and what you’d already read. And it was far far more efficient than
going from site to site hitting refresh like a rat pressing a lever for
another hit of crack. This is especially true for people (like me) that
read a lot of sites that don’t publish very often or can go through long
dry spells.</p>

<p>I found the Google Reader web site kind of clunky and ugly, but you didn’t
actually have to ever visit it to experience the benefits. Google Reader
also provided a service so that third party apps could access the same
data and keep your subscriptions in sync if you used apps on different
PC’S or post-PC devices. This is what I used to do, and it was
fantastic. I would use the beautiful/fast/powerful
<a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> app on my phone, Mac, and iPad to browse
my feeds wherever I was. I even used the Google Reader website
occasionally.</p>

<p>And then Google announced they were shutting it all down on July 1.
Panic ensued, but the nerderati told us to be patient–they promised
even better alternatives would quickly blossom to take its place.  It
took a few months, but they were right. Unfortunately, I’ve had a busy
spring and summer and haven’t had the time to try them all to find the
best one.  Luckily, lots of other folks have invested their time
and I think there’s a decent consensus for a winner.</p>

<a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/06/feedle-dee-dee/">Dr. Drang</a>
have all settled on Feed Wrangler.  It’s a service that offers all the
features Google Reader did.  It costs $19.99 per year, but that’s a
small price to pay for stability.  With paying customers, they won’t
have nearly the temptation to just turn it off if they don’t feel like
running it anymore.  They won’t be shoving ads down our throat either
which I always felt was just around the corner with Google Reader.</p>

<p>Feed Wrangler has a web site for reading and also provides free client
apps for the iPhone and iPad.  The iPhone client has some serious
flaws. It’s definitely slower to sync new stuff than Reeder was. It
doesn’t support gestures to mark things read or unread.  And worst of
all, the default (unchangeable) font size is too small for me to read
unless I’m wearing my reading glasses. Thank goodness my old standby
Reeder will be supporting Feed Wrangler soon.  I don’t read much on my
iPad, but Mr. Reader already supports the Feed Wrangler service.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part about Feed Wrangler is the two things it does that
Google Reader never did.  Smart Streams let you define “collections” of
articles based on keywords and sources.  It’s much more powerful than a
folder and will let me sip from the high volume feeds that I would normally
stay away from. Filters are the opposite–you can define key words that
will cause an article to be automatically considered read and thus
ignored.  This way I can subscribe to the ESPN feed and never have to
read another story about hockey or NASCAR.  Bill Simmons’ <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmonsnfl2010/101105">ESPN
Outsider</a>
has arrived!</p>

<p>Google Reader is dead, but it was stagnant for years.  I’m legitimately excited about
a new era of innovation. Feed Wrangler has just won round one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I loved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books">Wizard of Oz</a> when I was a kid. Not the movie and not just the book, but the whole series of books and the whole world of Oz and the whole host of amazing characters. L. Frank Baum wrote 14 books and by the end of second grade I had read them all. The Scarecrow, the Patchwork Girl, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gump#The_Gump">the Gump</a>, the Cowardly Lion, and the Hungry Tiger (just to name a few) were some of my best friends. Given that my daughter R has a wild imagination and a voracious appetite for books, you can’t blame me for introducing  these stories as soon as possible. Actually, it was too soon.</p>

<p>We started reading a seriously condensed picture book version when she was about two years old. She thought it was terrific and for months all she wanted to do was to act out the story. She was Dorothy for Halloween last year, and right around R’s 4th birthday, we read a chapter of the unabridged <em>Wizard of Oz</em> every night. She loved it and even though it revved her up a little right before she was supposed to go to sleep, we finished it and dove right into the <em>Land of Oz</em>. Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse were as fun as the original characters and we zipped through <em>Ozma of Oz</em> where we got to meet our first Oz princess.</p>

<p>We hit a wall with <em>Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz</em>. The invisible bears were just too scary. That night it took a little longer than usual to get to sleep and the next night, R wanted to read something else. </p>

<p>Last weekend we had a similar experience.  As soon as it got warm enough, R has been zooming around on her pink Dora bike with training wheels. We would go as fast as we caould around the block and I would run down the hills to keep up with her. She was looking a little cramped and since the seat wouldn’t go up any higher, I thought it was time for a new bike. Our awesome local shop (<a href="http://www.thedevilsgear.com">The Devil’s Gear</a>) had a used 16” bike that was perfect and we picked it up. It didn’t have training wheels and R said that was fine with her.</p>

<p>I also thought since B just turned two, she was ready for her first bike. We decided to pick up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MyKick-Balance-Bike-Cotton-Candy/dp/B009T2SITU">Burley MyKick</a>. It’s got two wheels and no pedals so you learn to balance right away. My friend Google tells me it’s easier to transition to a “real bike” from one of these than from a bike with training wheels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we did not have the fun-filled weekend of bike-riding that I was hoping for.  As soon as we got home, we learned  that both kids were too little for their new bikes. Seats only go so low. The only short term benefit was that R enjoyed racing the MyKick up and down the driveway.</p>

<p>This weekend things got a lot better. R decided she was ready to ride her new bike and this evening we did 4 laps around the block!  It didn’t take long for her to master the straight-aways up hill and down hill. But the seat is still too high and she needs support to start or stop. She’s going to be a menace to herself and our neighbors for a while yet.</p>

<p>Books and bikes are pretty low stakes things, and I don’t feel so bad starting them on the early side. We’ll return to Oz at some point. Our new bikes will be be there when the girls are totally ready. But some decisions are a lot harder to recover from if you make a mistake. Parents of kids who were born late in the year know where I’m going with this: When is the right time to start school?</p>

<p>I’m a December birthday and I started first grade when I was 5. My mom had to convince the principal to bend the rules since technically I was supposed to be 6 by September 1. Throughout elementary, middle school, and high school I was the youngest kid in the class. I was pretty emotionally immature. I had regular “accidents” until third grade. I always had trouble with girls and I think at least part of that was being younger than they were. And yet I feel strongly that it was the right decision for me. I was curious and intellectually ambitious and competitive. I would have been bored silly if I had been held back and even as it was, I wish I’d been challenged more. </p>

<p>I’ve also met lots of people with late in the year birthdays that were pushed into school early, and they’re bitter about it to this day. They really believe they would have had a more comfortable and successful school experience had their parents waited. And maybe their parents should have waited.</p>

<p>The trendy thing to do now is to wait. I swear it all started when Malcolm Gladwell’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922">Outliers</a> came out in 2008.  In the first chapter, he tells a story about how elite Canadian hockey players were all born in January or February. When these guys started playing, they were the biggest, most skilled kids on their age-graded teams and so were plucked out and given additional training/coaching. Maybe being the oldest kid in kindergarten or first grade helps with academics too. Maybe.</p>

<p>I strongly believe the “right” answer about when to start school depends on the kid (and the school). R was born in late November and will be starting kindergarten next year (before she turns 5). We will be watching her closely. The academic part of school will be no problem. She’s already got great reading and math skills and she loves to learn. On the social/emotional side, she acts her age. That might be hard when most of her friends are older. We are definitely open to having her repeat kindergarten at a new school. We’re also open to her moving on to first grade. We’re not open to doing something just because everyone else is doing it. We’ll make the decision based on her.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I dreamt I was at my high school reunion. Near the end of dinner, one of the organizers came to my table and asked if everyone who was gay would raise their hand because they were planning a separate meeting just for gay alumni. Six attendees from our table of 26 raised their hands. I had no idea about five of them, and while my first reaction was surprise, my second was pride in the social change that’s happened over the last 25 years.</p>

<p>In just the last year, we’ve had the first male American athlete in a major sport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Collins">Jason Collins</a>) come out with near universal acceptance. The number one draft pick in the WNBA draft (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner">Britney Griner</a>) mentioned she was gay and hardly anyone noticed. The Supreme Court seems on the verge of legalizing gay marriage (or at least banning the states from banning gay marriage).  And my (almost) alma mater<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Framingham High School, now has a club called the <a href="http://www.framingham.k12.ma.us/fhs_alliance.cfm">Gay/Straight Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>The reunion and the casual statements about sexual orientation by my old friends may have been a dream, but the reality is much better. Some of the healthiest and most loving couples I know are gay. Some of the best parents I know are gay. And it’s so nice that this is finally being recognized by a majority of Americans.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am frustrated and I know I’m not the only one. I want
want a photo management system that requires minimum maintenance and gives me maximum flexibility. I’ve complained about this <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/09/im-not-happy/">before</a>, but I’m tired of waiting for Apple to hand me a gift-wrapped solution.  They didn’t last summer in iOS 6 and I have no faith that they will in iOS 7.</p>

<p>In my household, we take most of our photos with our phones, but we also have a big digital SLR which we break out for big events (if we remember to). Ideally, all our pictures would be automatically whisked away into a shared database in the cloud as soon as they are taken. From there we should be able to browse, organize, edit, and share them from any of our device, be they Macs, PC’s, iPads, or iPhones. In 2013, I don’t think that’s unreasonable to ask for.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks, I’ll be looking at several products and hopefully finding answers.  Today the journey starts with two separate app/service combos.  One is Adobe Revel and the other is Everpix.</p>

<h2 id="adobe-revelhttpwwwadoberevelcom"><a href="http://www.adoberevel.com">Adobe Revel</a></h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-adobe-revel.png" /></p>

<p>I was super-excited when I heard about Adobe Revel.  The service stores all your pictures in the cloud, and they give you free iOS and Mac apps to edit and manage them. Pictures are streamed to your iOS devices as needed freeing up a whole lot of space.  The apps are (supposedly) built on top of the same editing/browsing engine powering LightRoom and they are (actually) very well done.  The service is expensive ($5.99/month) but it promises a lot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s missing some important features.  First, it won’t store video clips and that means I need an entirely different workflow for them.  With two little kids, we take lots of these “long photos” and I like having them mixed in with the traditional photos. Second, my wife lives in a Windows world and Revel doesn’t provide a Windows app or even a web app. That means she can only browse our library on her phone and that’s a show stopper.</p>

<h2 id="everpixhttpwwweverpixcom"><a href="http://www.everpix.com">Everpix</a></h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-everpix.png" /></p>

<p>After my experience with Revel, I was cautiously optimistic about Everpix. It also stores all your photos in the cloud and has terrific iOS apps for browsing your collection, but it differentiates itself in three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They automatically import photos from lots of places you might care about including your photo roll, Facebook, Instagram, and Flickr. That’s nice, but not terribly useful for me since I’m not exactly tied into the social network world.</li>
  <li>They have a terrific web app that works well on Mac and Windows.</li>
  <li>They don’t allow you to create albums or tag photos but instead rely on “science” to organize your photos for you.  Since I always plan to do more manual organization than I actually do, it’s nice that this is done for me. I tend to take several pictures of the same thing but never delete the bad ones–Everpix does a decent job picking the good ones and showing you those first.  In fact, I have Everpix configured to email me “random” “reminder” pictures from my collection everyday and it’s a lot of fun.</li>
</ol>

<p>The package is expensive ($4.99/month) if you want them to store more than the previous year’s worth of photos, and I’d be happy to pay if it weren’t for the downsides:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They don’t store video clips.</li>
  <li>You can’t edit pictures within the apps.</li>
  <li>They don’t store original images. Instead, Everpix stores compressed versions. I’m no photo snob, but I also don’t like losing information.</li>
  <li>You can’t easily export pictures. Once your pictures are inside, you can only get them out piece meal. I hate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m keeping an eye on Everpix because except for the editing, these issues seem eminently fixable and I’d consider using an external editor if I had to.</p>

<p>The quest continues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend a lot of time on this blog raving about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/04/11/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-3/">great kid books</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/02/22/not-dead-yet/">great music</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/01/17/mincer-1958/">great writing for grown ups</a>, and even <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/01/08/an-homage-to-chris-welty/">great teaching</a>, but don’t get the idea that I think everything is all sunshine and roses. There are plenty of things I don’t appreciate. Here are just three:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-grateful-dead.jpg" title="[title &#34;Maybe the Ugliest Shirt of All-Time&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;Maybe the Ugliest Shirt of All-Time&#34;]" /></p>

<h2 id="the-grateful-dead">1. The Grateful Dead</h2>

<p>When I think of the Dead, the first things that come to mind are dirty feet, ugly tie-dyed shirts, drugs, and silly annoying songs that just go on and on and on.  If you’re into that sort of thing, then I’m really sorry you can’t follow them around anymore.  At least you’ve got Phish.</p>

<h2 id="ezra-jack-keats">2. Ezra Jack Keats</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hv-willie.jpg" title="[title &#34;Whistle for Willie&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;Whistle for Willie&#34;]" /></p>

<p>This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Jack_Keats">Ezra Jack Keats</a> week at my girls’ preschool and besides <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/">Eric Carle</a>, there isn’t a more over-rated children’s book author/illustator.  I’m not an expert on Jack Keats, but I have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Snowy-Day-Board-Book/dp/0670867330">The Snowy Day</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whistle-Willie-Board-Book-Keats/dp/0670880469">Whistle for Willie</a> and thus feel perfectly justified generalizing to his whole body of work. I like that he his stories take place in cities. I like that he’s got African-American characters. And I’m not arguing he wasn’t an important trail blazer–he was. I’m just arguing that the books themselves are uninspired and boring.  In the last forty years lots of authors have taken the torch and done a better job with it. My favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rain-Stomper-Addie-Boswell/dp/0761453938">The Rain Stomper</a> (by Boswell Addie, illustrated by Eric Velasquez), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a> (by Don Freeman), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bear-Bike-Stella-Blackstone/dp/1905236980">Bear on a Bike</a> (by Stella Blackstone, illustrated by Debbie Harter)</p>

<h2 id="new-orleans">3. New Orleans</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/hv-voodoo.jpg" title="[title &#34;VOODOO&#34;]" alt="[title &#34;VOODOO&#34;]" /></p>

<p>For some people, New Orleans is a great city. It’s got world class sea food and its own brand of jazz. It’s got a casino downtown and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street">whole street</a> full of daiquiris and debauchery. But for a vegetarian who doesn’t drink, doesn’t gamble, and whose musical tastes are a little less hip, New Orleans doesn’t have much to offer. I used to think the best thing about the city was voodoo and while that sounds all cool and mysterious, when you take a closer look, it’s not. Chicken blood, bits of hair, and stabbing little dolls to hurt real people is just creepy. Of course, there is <a href="http://www.auduboninstitute.org/visit/insectarium">the Insectarium</a> which is also a little creepy, but was a lot of fun with the girls when we visited a couple weeks ago. </p>

<p>OK, I’ll admit it: I’m not usually such a Debby Downer, but  accumulated sleep debt from a busy winter and spring has taken a toll on my normally sunny disposition. Hopefully the end of the semester will take care of this I’ll soon be back to being a Cheerful Charlie!</p>
