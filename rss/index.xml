    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-adi.jpg" /></p>

<p>Adi Gildor was my best friend. He killed himself last week. I still can&rsquo;t believe it, but this is what I said at his memorial service:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
I know I&#8217;m not the only person here who thought of Adi as their best friend.  He was that kind of guy. We grew up together. We were still growing up together and we were supposed to grow old together. I gave the best man toast at his wedding, but I <strong>never</strong> ever thought I would be up here speaking today.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
I can&#8217;t tell you how many times Adi called me over the last few years and said &#8220;We should go back to Moab to go mountain biking again&#8221; or &#8220;Let&#8217;s road trip to Mexico again,&#8221; and I would say &#8220;Definitely, but not yet.&#8221; Just like Adi, I&#8217;ve got two little kids, but my wife isn&#8217;t as cool with me going off on adventures without her as Rose was. We won&#8217;t get to do those things together now, but at least we did them the first time.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
Adi and I met when we were in high school. We were just a couple of nerdy teenagers who thought we knew more than we actually did. Adi taught me how to curse in Spanish, how to appreciate Shakespeare, and how to recognize the hot peppers in Thai food. That last one, he taught me only <strong>after</strong> I ate one. He thought it was hilarious. We learned together how to avoid getting stuffed into lockers by the football players. And then we both grew four inches in college and didn&#8217;t have to worry about that sort of thing anymore.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
There were things about Adi that never changed over the years.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
He was the most generous guy I knew. He would literally <strong>give you the shirt</strong> off his back. One of my favorite shirts is one that Adi left at my house a few years ago. When I said I liked it he told me I should keep it. It was brown and a little shiny and had snaps. Rose remembers it. He would send me shoes and jackets too. We even had an ugly t-shirt club where we would send each other shirts and dare each other to wear them. I think I still have a My Little Pony shirt he sent me.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
Adi knew how to have a <strong>good time</strong>. We went snorkeling in the South Pacific in a tiny country called Palau. We hiked and camped all over the 4 corners. We even bike-packed in Baja California where we drove on some of the worst roads you&#8217;ll ever see in my Honda CRX. It was never the same after that trip. I mostly stopped doing these adventures with him when kids were born, but he certainly didn&#8217;t stop!
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
You always <strong>knew where you stood with Adi</strong>. When he was mad, he would say I&#8217;m mad at you. And he would tell you why. Sometimes it was reasonable: I called you a week ago; Why haven&#8217;t you called me back? Sometimes it wasn&#8217;t: I told you to watch that movie a week ago; Why haven&#8217;t you watched it yet?
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
And he always had a keen sense of <strong>justice</strong>. I remember one time he was living in Colorado Springs walking his dog Eloise late at night. Some guys drove real fast right by them and Adi ran after them yelling. The car stopped and three of them got out of the car to ask if he had a problem. The guy talking was a lot bigger than Adi, so Adi hit him first. When he went down, the guy&#8217;s two &#8220;friends&#8221; took off. After giving the guy a pretty hard time, Adi felt sorry for him and I&#8217;m pretty sure Adi ended up giving him a ride home.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
When Adi realized that the artsy Colorado Springs movie theater only gave student discounts to students at four year colleges, he wrote a letter about it to the local newspaper. And just a couple months ago he told me about confronting a couple guys at his gym who had the nerve to be drinking smoothies in the hot tub. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
Adi would listen to advice, but at the end of the day, Adi <strong>followed his heart</strong>. Well after he finished college, he enlisted in the army and went through boot camp. Then he got tired of living in Massachusetts and moved to Colorado Springs. Why? He liked the high desert, the cheap living, and the great hiking, biking, and snowboarding. And it had a very good public library. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
The figured out what he wanted and just did it. The best example of all is that he married the woman he loved. Sure, she was a lot younger than him. Sure, she was Jewish. He didn&#8217;t care. He loved her so he married her.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
I never thought I&#8217;d see Adi &#8220;settle down&#8221;, but he did and he did it on his own terms. He grew up, he took responsibility, but he never stopped having fun. He had two kids, but they only made his life <strong>more</strong> fun. When I talked to him last week he told me about how had been running in the woods with Henry. They would play crazy make-believe games and when Henry got tired, Adi would put him on his back and run around some more.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
Adi never cared about stuff. He cared about his friends, his family, and his lived experience. He loved <strong>doing</strong> stuff. Snowboarding, hanging out with people, arguing about ideas, making plans, reading. That&#8217;s why the way he died is so shocking. He <strong>loved living</strong>.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
In my heart I believe that what happened that night was an aberration. It shouldn&#8217;t have happened and it was not who he was 99% of the time. I&#8217;m not going to deny what happened at the end, but I&#8217;m going to remember the Adi in my heart that loved his family, loved his friends, and loved life.
</p>

<p>You can also watch the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Ax2diXNzY">Memorial Service</a> (including this eulogy) on YouTube.

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/06/21/single-mom/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/06/21/single-mom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-mommy-and-me.jpg" /></p>

<p>A good friend who is a single mom recently published <a href="https://singlemomintheivyleagues.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/fathers-male-role-models-and-raising-a-boy/">an article about the angst she feels on Father&rsquo;s Day</a>. She wonders aloud what her son might or might not be missing out on by growing up with only a mom in the house. I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there, and wanted to share my personal experience as an only (and male) child of a single mom.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get the biology nonsense out of the way first. I did not need a man around to teach me how to pee, how to shave, or about the birds and the bees. Holding your penis and aiming it at the toilet just isn&rsquo;t that hard. Shaving a face is not that different from shaving legs. As for sex, my friends told me about the basics, and my mom taught me to treat women decently. There isn&rsquo;t any secret knowledge about sex that fathers have to transmit to their sons. Or if there is, I seem to be getting by just fine without it.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t live with a &ldquo;male role model,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m not sure what I would have gained from it. People are different in many ways beyond gender. I didn&rsquo;t have an athlete role model or a computer nerd role model in the house either but still managed to be a decent amateur swimmer and eventually a professional programmer. Then there&rsquo;s the fact that role models don&rsquo;t have to live with you. Teachers, neighbors, coaches, parents of friends can all be role models. My local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=TRS-80_Color_Computer">Radio Shack Color Computer</a> Club was loaded with role models. And finally, my mother was a terrific role model as a teacher, an artist, and a lifelong learner.</p>

<p>I did grow up with many &ldquo;traditionally male&rdquo; interests, and sure, it would have been nice to have a dad around who could show me how to hold a bat or identify sports cars we saw in the wild. But I had many other interests too. My mom took me to concerts, and plays and museums. She indulged my creative side and brought me to the beach all summer long. I got to have long uninterrupted conversations with her because it was just the two of us.</p>

<p>To be honest, the only thing I feel like I missed out on by having a single mom was getting to closely observe two adults in a healthy relationship. It took me some extra time to figure out how to create and maintain these kinds of relationships since they were new. On the other hand, many kids in two parent families don&rsquo;t get to see that either and instead learn bad tastes and behaviors that are hard to break. I got to start with a clean slate.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that my mom did a wonderful job raising me, and I think most single moms have all the tools they need: Their kids are in great hands.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[In praise of dentists]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/06/03/in-praise-of-dentists/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/06/03/in-praise-of-dentists</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-dental-exam.png" /></p>

<p>My whole life I&rsquo;ve hated going to the dentist. The sound of the drill. The smell of decay being ground away. Spitting out shards of teeth and blood. And let&rsquo;s not forget the often intense physical pain. I know dentists do important work, and I know the world would be a lot worse without them, but I&rsquo;ll never enjoy the experience of someone digging around in my mouth, and I&rsquo;ll always dread my next visit.</p>

<p>My goal in this article is not to praise dentists in general, but instead, to express my sincere appreciation for three specific dentists who went above and beyond the call of duty to make my dad&rsquo;s life better. My father has had problems with his dentures since the day he got them. That&rsquo;s the downside of picking a prosthodontist because her office is one block away from your apartment. My dad needed someone new to fix his teeth or make new ones, but neither of us knew anything about dentists in northern New Jersey. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.drgalexander.com">Dr. Gerald Alexander</a> is my dentist in New Haven, and he&rsquo;s the best dentist I&rsquo;ve ever had. He takes pride in every aspect of his work, his office is spotless, and his staff are top notch. I know he treats them well because he&rsquo;s had no turnover in the six years I&rsquo;ve been seeing him. And of course, his actual dentistry is excellent. </p>

<p>Dr. A is well-connected, and I thought he might know someone good in New Jersey that could help my dad. Even though he didn&rsquo;t, he did make a whole bunch of phone calls on my dad&rsquo;s behalf, not stopping until he found someone close by that he trusted: <a href="http://www.periodontist-englewood.com/dr-patil.html">Dr. Chetan Patil</a> in Englewood. </p>

<p>Dr Patil is a periodontist and he was happy to see my dad right away. During our appointment his staff were patient and understanding. When Dr Patil finished checking out my dad&rsquo;s gums, he could have just done the work himself, but he knew someone else who was a lot better with dentures than he was. Dr. Patil&rsquo;s staff made a quick phone call for us, and <a href="http://www.easthilldental.com/meet-the-doctors/">Dr Javier Urquiola</a> said he could fit us in as his last appointment that day. We rushed right over.</p>

<p>Dr Urquiola didn&rsquo;t just throw out the existing dentures and start over. He spent an hour working to repair and adjust the old dentures and got a perfect fit for the top denture. The bottom partial was much improved but it wasn&rsquo;t possible to make it stable. Dr. Urquiola stayed late that day to make an impression for a new one. Since then he&rsquo;s worked with my dad (not the easiest patient) to make sure the new denture fits as well as it possibly can.</p>

<p>Thank you Drs. Alexander, Patil, and Urquiola. You are truly making the world a better place.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/05/25/la-la-love-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJtDXIazrMo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>When this song first hit pop radio, I hated it. It’s unoriginal, it drones on and on, and my kids love it so I can’t change the radio station when it comes on. The worst part is that it’s from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2322441/">50 Shades of Grey</a>, and makes me think of that creepy guy doing bad things to the girl whenever I hear it. On the other hand, it is catchy, and I do like the trashy Euro-disco stylings of Ellie Goulding. I’ve recently found one more reason to appreciate the song.</p>

<p>I was one of those kids who loved making mix tapes in the 80’s. I recorded my friend’s older sister’s Beach Boys singles with my little Radio Shack cassette deck. I also recorded all my favorite tv show theme songs on a single tape. I once made a mix that alternated Black Sabbath and Beatles songs just because I could. My hobby blossomed in the 2000’s with the arrival of iTunes and playlists. I was a little more mature, so the collections of songs I created then are a mostly more straight-forward; e.g., “My favorite Hair Metal” and “Totally Rockin 80’s Party”. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best play list I ever made was “Stammer Rock”. You would be amazed how many songs make stuttering a key element of the song. You would also be amazed by how many pop genres these songs span and how well they flow together. You don’t have to take my word for it: Now you too can experience the slightly absurd spectacle of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/126603624/playlist/5IKVarjm4m0bpDVzritAWK">Stammer Rock on Spotify</a>. I challenge you listen all the way through without smiling and shaking your head.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-book-with-no-pictures.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Over the last couple weeks, the most popular book in our house, by far, has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-No-Pictures-B-J-Novak/dp/0803741715">The Book with No Pictures</a> by B.J. Novak. The gimmick is simple: When someone reads the book out loud, they have to say all the words. No matter how silly or ridiculous or preposterous or even nonsensical they might be. The reader may even have to sing the occasional song about eating ants for breakfast. Novak takes full advantage of this rule to induce huge laughs from the audience. The idea is partially ripped off from (inspired by?) Mo Willems&rsquo; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Book-Elephant-Piggie/dp/1423133080">We are in a Book</a>, but it&rsquo;s executed so well I can&rsquo;t really complain.</p>

<p>Ever since we got this book, both kids (age 3 and 6) beg every grown-up that enters our house to read it. And how can you say to no to a kid begging you to read a book? Especially when you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming? With many funny kids books, we can all laugh together. With this one, the kids are definitely laughing <em>at</em> the reader. Luckily this is a situation where quantity matters more than quality.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/02/22/darn-you-taylor-swift/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/02/22/darn-you-taylor-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/darn-you.png" /></p>

<p>Dear Taylor,</p>

<p>When you decided to pull all of your music out of Spotify, the economist in me understood. You did a cost benefit analysis and realized the pennies per play you were getting from Spotify just didn&rsquo;t add up to that many millions of dollars. That is, if you dropped Spotify like a bad boyfriend, enough Spotify listeners  would be compelled to pony up for the album to make you even more money.</p>

<p>The catchy pop song enthusiast in me was less excited about your decision&ndash;My monthly Spotify fee is supposed to protect me from having to buy any albums at all. When you left, I was okay for a while because even though the first single on 1989 was good, I was able to shake off the temptation to purchase it since at any particular moment, it was playing on at least one local radio station.</p>

<p>Then came your second single which was better than the first. Even though it was on the radio <em>almost</em> all the time, I still had a blank space in my heart since I couldn&rsquo;t hear it <em>any</em> tine I wanted.  Bent but not broken, I stayed true to my principles and refused to buy.</p>

<p>Your third single was the best yet&ndash;exactly my style with that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQalkIeE7s">Alan Parsons Project inspired</a> pure 80&rsquo;s guitar line. I could not resist. I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. Spotify has my money and now you have another <code>$9.09</code> (iTunes takes <code>30%</code> off the <code>$12.99</code> purchase price). </p>

<p>Your whole album is a tour de force of syrupy sweet catchiness, and I am glad that I now own a legal copy of it forever. It can never be ripped away from me on some artist&rsquo;s whim like all of my other Spotify favorites. And if I fall on hard times, I won&rsquo;t need to pay Spotify (or Beats or rdio) to prop me up. My leglly purchased Taylor Swift albums will carry me through. </p>

<p>The problem is I&rsquo;m not who I thought I was. I thought I was stronger. I thought I could stay true. You made me look in the mirror and see the real truth: A flesh and blood person with flaws and needs.</p>

<p>Darn you Taylor Swift!</p>

<p>Your frenemy forever,</p>

<p>Doug</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/02/16/kbr-winter-classics/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2015/02/16/kbr-winter-classics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-brave-irene.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Now that we are deep into a winter that will seemingly never end, it&rsquo;s time to look at a few classic children&rsquo;s books that can carry us through.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brave-Irene-William-Steig/dp/0312564228">Brave Irene</a> (by William Steig, 1986) William Steig is one of the few authors I know who doesn&rsquo;t shy away from true drama. He&rsquo;s better known for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sylvester-Magic-Pebble-William-Steig/dp/1442435607">Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</a> which features parents bawling their eyes out over their long lost son, but in this book Irene has to brave a serious winter storm at night to deliver a dress her mom has made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Irene pushed forward with all her strength and&ndash;sloosh! thwump!&ndash;she plunged downward and was buried. She had fallen off a little cliff. Only her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.
Even if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered. Why not freeze to death, she thought, and let all these troubles end. Why not? She was already buried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it all turns out wonderfully at the end, but boy, both my girls (and I) were on the edge of our seats the whole time!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-100-dresses.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Dresses-Eleanor-Estes/dp/0152052607">The Hundred Dresses</a> (written by Eleanor Estes, illustrated by Louis Slobodkin, 1945) R and I really enjoyed this Newberry Honor winning chapter book about two girls who tease a poor immigrant girl from Poland into moving out of town. Both girls feel bad, but one feels worse about it than the other. I don&rsquo;t want to give anything away, but the story feels amazingly real, right down to the messy ending. </p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-moominland-midwinter.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moominland-Midwinter-Moomins-Tove-Jansson/dp/0312625413">Moominland Midwinter</a> (by Tove Jansson, 1957) Last week I was a <a href="http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/035-eliciting-using-feedback-students/">guest on the Teaching in Higher Ed podcast</a> and I one of my recommendations was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finn-Family-Moomintroll-Moomins-Jansson/dp/0312608896">Finn Family Moomintroll</a>, another book in this amazing series of stories about Moomintroll and his friends and family which take place in magical land far to the north. The stories and characters are rich enough to appeal to adults but clear and exciting enough to capture kids&rsquo; imaginations too. It&rsquo;s criminal how under-appreciated (and unknown) these books are in the United States.</p>

    <updated>2014-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/12/08/kbr-details</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid, I liked nothing better then settling down in a corner with a big detailed picture book like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Scarrys-Busy-Town/dp/0307168034">Busy, Busy Town</a> and poring over each page looking for things I’d never seen before. My 6-year-old daughter is exactly the same, although the particular books she enjoys are different. Here are three of her favorites:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-crabtree.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crabtree-Jon-Nichols/dp/1936365820">Crabtree</a> (by Jon and Tucker Nichols, 2013) Alfred Crabtree is a weird dude who loses his false teeth and spends the story searching his belongs for them. This takes a while because he seemingly never throws anything away. The quirky drawings, odd organization, and carefully typed captions are all hilarious. <a href="http://kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a> (Internet-curator-extraordinaire) <a href="http://kottke.org/14/03/crabtree">recommended this book</a>, and he has yet to steer me wrong. The only downside is that it will be hard to find a copy to buy if your library doesn’t have one.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-welcome-to-mamoko.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Mamoko-Aleksandra-Mizielinska/dp/0763668915">Welcome to Mamoko</a> (by Aleksandra Mizielinska and Daniel Mizielinski, 2010) We actually got this book because we loved the authors’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maps-Aleksandra-Mizielinska/dp/0763668966">Maps</a> so much. The story is introduced with a big cast of characters and a question about each (e.g., “Olaf Brown has a big day ahead. Who helps him out of a spot of trouble?”). What follows is a sequence of double page wordless scenes with all the characters in different urban settings. Even my three year-old loves to try to figure out what’s going on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Mamoko-Aleksandra-Mizielinska/dp/0763668915">Incredible Comparisons</a> (written by Russell Ash, illustrated by Stephen Biesty, 1996) My 6-year-old loves books with bite-sized amazing facts, and in this DK book almost every fact is accompanied by a beautiful picture. A blue whale weighs as much as 26 elephants. The moon is as wide as Australia. Angel Falls is three times taller than the Eiffel Tower. The Great Pyramid weighs as much as 16 Empire State Buildings! Highly recommended.</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/12/07/zebras-and-expertise-on-the-internet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Internet is full of people talking about stuff they don’t know much about. It’s common at <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com">Yahoo Answers</a> and <a href="http://www.answers.com">Answers.com</a>, but <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> reviews and <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> are rife with it too. Even when bloggers are experts in one area, they often write much more broadly. As <a href="http://idlewords.com/about.htm">Maclej Ceglowski</a> delightfully points out in <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm">his article about Paul Graham’s lack of expertise on painting</a>, even the top of the food chain is not immune. </p>

<p>I think it’s fantastic. You don’t need to be an expert to have something interesting to say. Regular people notice things experts don’t, and they often have a perspective closer to mine. Non-experts can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Funniest-Amazon-Product-Reviews/lm/RM0256CJKINZJ">incredibly entertaining</a>.</p>

<p>As a consumer I’m careful not to take anything too seriously, but many folks are more trusting than me of the average blogger. As a producer, I worry about this all the time, as I love thinking and writing about things on the edge (or well over the edge) of my expertise. When I wildly speculate I try to be clear about it, but I feel a little bad that some readers might not notice. </p>

<p>It has turned out that the most common way for people to find this site is by searching for “are zebras mean” or “do zebras bite.” I don’t know jack about this subject, but that didn’t stop me from writing <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/03/01/why-are-zebras-so-mean-and-horses-so-nice/">a few hundred words about it</a> a couple years ago.  African Safari guide <a href="http://www.quora.com/Rory-Young-1">Rory Young</a> recently wrote <a href="http://www.quora.com/Can-zebras-be-domesticated-and-trained/answer/Rory-Young-1">a terrific article on Quora</a> that shares real knowledge about why zebras can be so nasty.  It makes me very happy to be able to send my potentially disappointed visitors on to some real answers.</p>

    <updated>2014-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/12/01/kbr-finding-my-niche</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you look in the right places on the Internet, you can find terrific suggestions for books to read with your kids. Many of these recommendations are written by teachers and librarians who are tapped into the very latest and coolest new books. The downside is that I now have long wish lists of books that my local library hasn’t had a chance to buy yet. A year from now, my library might have some, but until then, my only option is to shell out real money for a brand new copy.</p>

<p>The fact is there are real gems hiding on the shelves of most libraries waiting to be discovered or rediscovered. That’s what you’ll find here: good books that I know can be found at at least one library (mine) and hopefully yours. </p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-the-quiet-place.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Place-Sarah-Stewart/dp/0374325650">The Quiet Place</a> (written by Sarah Stewart, illustrated by David Small, 2012) This book is told as a series of letters written by a young girl who moves from Mexico to the US. She starts nervous but excited and even though she has a wonderful mother and brother, she misses the family and home she’s left behind. Gradually, she makes a new home and new friends. I don’t think the author was an immigrant herself, but she really captures the experience and brought a tear to my eye.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-pish-posh.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pish-Posh-Said-Hieronymus-Bosch/dp/0152622101">Pish, Posh, Said Hieronymus Bosch</a> (written by Nancy Willard, illustrated by Leo, Diane, and Lee Dillon, 1991) On the one hand, it seems totally insane to turn Bosch’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch#mediaviewer/File:The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg">psychadelic visions of hell</a> into a children’s book, but on the other, kids love big eccentric detailed illustrations (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Scarrys-Busy-Town/dp/0307168034">Richard Scarry’s Busy, Busy Town</a>) and those are right in Bosch’s wheel house. This is the story of the artist, his housekeeper, and their unusual house, and it totally works.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-bog-baby.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bog-Baby-Jeanne-Willis/dp/0375861769">Bog Baby</a> (written by Jeanne Willis, illustrated by Gwen Millward, 2009) I love stories about kids who find animals, take them home, and then realize that wild animals need to be wild. Angelina Ballerina learns the lesson with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Angelina-Butterfly-Ballerina-Katharine-Holabird/dp/0448440156">butterfly</a>, Mole learns the lesson with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mole-Baby-Bird-Marjorie-Newman/dp/1582347840">baby bird</a>, and in this book, two sisters learn the lesson with a fantastical creature called a bog baby.  The pen and ink illustrations are unique and beautiful.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-alpha-oops.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AlphaOops-Day-Z-Went-First/dp/0763660841">AlphaOops: The Day Z Went First</a> (written by Alethea Kontis, illustrated Bob Kolar) Why does A always get to go first? Z decides it’s time to mix things up and hilarity ensues. Both my girls (now 6 and 3.5 years old) thought this book was a lot of fun.</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/11/24/kbr-jenny-and-the-cat-club</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-jenny-and-the-cat-club.jpg" /></p>

<p>Over the summer I discovered a <a href="(http://www.teachmentortexts.com/)">whole community of folks</a> on the Internet who read and blog about kids books. It was very exciting and I had great fun reading their work and sharing mine <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/14/monday-reading/">here</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/21/violence-in-picture-books/">here</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/28/kbr-eclectic/">here</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/08/04/poetry-for-kids/">here</a> and <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/09/01/kbr-travel-edition/">here</a>. Then the Fall came and I fell into the teaching vortex. Sunday nights turned into lecture preparation marathons, and I&rsquo;ve been spending Monday mornings and afternoons presenting the fruits of this labor. I&rsquo;ve scratched my blogging itch on <a href="http://teachbetter.co">Teach Better</a>, but the <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/categories/kbr/">Kid Book Review</a> section of <a href="http://highvariance.net">High Variance</a> has lain fallow. What better way to celebrate my first Monday off in ages (for Thanksgiving Break), than with an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/imwayr">#IMWAYR</a> post!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-the-fire-cat.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I was a kid, one of my very favorite books was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Cat-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064440389">The Fire Cat</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Averill">Esther Averill</a>. The main character was not bad or good&ndash;Like people in the real world, Pickles was a mix of both. He was born strong and ambitious, but with no idea what to do with his gifts. He spends his time terrorizing smaller cats, but eventually learns to be kind and finds his true calling working in a fire house.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I went to buy this book for my daughter a few years ago that I discovered Esther Averill had written a whole series of wonderful books about cats living in New York City! And in 2003, the New York Review reprinted most of them with nice affordably priced hardcover bindings. The books revolve around the adventures of a shy but strong (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/School-Cats-Review-Childrens-Collection/dp/159017173X">stronger than Pickles even</a>) black cat named Jenny Linsky and her friends in the Cat Club that meets in her garden.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-the-fire-cat.jpg" /></p>

<p>The series contains stories for a variety of ages starting with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jennys-Birthday-Book-Esther-Averill/dp/1590171543">Jenny&rsquo;s Birthday Book</a> for very little kids, moving to <a href="">The Fire Cat</a> which is an early reader, and culminating in several chapter books like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hotel-York-Review-Childrens-Collection/dp/1590171594">The Hotel Cat</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Captains-Streets-Review-Childrens-Collection/dp/1590171748">Captains of the City Streets</a>, that make great bedtime reading.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never had the pleasure of reading these books, the clear starting point is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jenny-Cat-Club-Collection-Childrens/dp/1590170474">Jenny and the Cat Club</a> where you learn how Jenny joined the club and meet all its colorful members. I can&rsquo;t recommend these books highly enough.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/09/18/taking-a-break-from-sports</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Real life is messy. We balance several life goals (family, career, personal) and many of these goals are difficult to even articulate clearly let alone achieve. For me, sports has always been an escape from life’s complexity. It’s a place where the goals are crystal clear and usually simple: <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/seahawks/2022823508_seahawks03xml.html">Win</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team">Win beautifully</a>. <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/abduljabbar_stats.html">Achieve milestones no has ever reached</a>. </p>

<p>I’ve been a sports fan my whole life, and I’ve always enjoyed seeing what people or teams can do when they push themselves as far as possible to achieve an extremely clear goal. Recently though, most of the big stories in sports have been about awful behavior of players, owners, and leagues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000393519/article/vikings-adrian-peterson-indicted-in-child-injury-case">Adrian Peterson beating his kid</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-rice-video-2014-9">Ray Rice beating his wife</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/why-was-michael-sam-cut-rams-personnel-decision-not-homophobia-1676156">Michael Sam tearing it up in preseason and then getting cut</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/2/14/5411608/worst-of-the-richie-incognito-jonathan-martin-report-miami-dolphins">The Dolphins bullying their own</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://nesn.com/2013/10/league-of-denial-shows-nfl-ignoring-concussion-evidence-mike-websters-fall-roger-goodell-digging-in/">The whole ongoing concussion saga in the NFL</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/5/30/5764162/clippers-sale-timeline-donald-sterling-steve-ballmer">Donald Sterling</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11454088/nfl-bans-jim-irsay-indianapolis-colts-six-games-fines-500k">Jim Irsay</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These stories sometimes get people talking about important social issues, but I find the whole thing rather depressing. I’m tired of caring about and rooting for people and institutions that I can’t respect. </p>

<p>A week ago I decided to take a break from sports. I was inspired by a new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-Football-Fans-Reluctant-Manifesto/dp/161219415X">Against Football</a>, but it was the Adrian Peterson story and the reaction of other players to it that pushed me over the edge. Beating your kid with a stick until he’s bruised and bleeding isn’t right no matter how you were raised.</p>

<p>So: No more <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/station/wfan/">sports radio</a> in the car. No more keeping up with the <a href="http://espn.go.com">ESPN news feed</a>. No more reading <a href="http://grantland.com">Grantland</a>. No more listening to <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2864045">the BS report</a>. It’s freed up quite a bit of time and I’ve found other ways to escape. I’m reading more <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> and catching up on my friends’ blogs. I’m getting more done at work.</p>

<p>At some point I’ll probably return to sports, but I want to come back for a good reason. I haven’t thought of one yet.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/09/01/kbr-travel-edition/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/09/01/kbr-travel-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every summer we fly off to California for one or two weeks of fun in the sun. At least during the day we have fun in the sun. There are also many of hours of fun in the dark every morning since we start the trip on Eastern Daylight Time, and there’s plenty of downtime mid-afternoon when we just want to chill. At home and away, books fill in these gaps between real-life adventures.</p>

<p>This trip we followed a three-prong reading strategy: First we packed a bunch of our favorite paperback books. We would have liked to bring more, but our bags were pretty heavy already. We had a mix of chapter books for R and picture books for both girls. Second, we brought our whole library of ebooks on our iPads. <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/02/13/ebooks-and-kids/">I far prefer physical picture books</a> and there aren’t nearly as many choices as I’d like, but there are some good ones and you can’t beat the weight. Third, we went to the <a href="http://www.lapl.org/branches/brentwood">local library</a> as soon as we arrived and picked up a big pile of books.</p>

<p>These are our top picks for the trip:</p>

<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-ipad-ebooks.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>On the iPad:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/would-you-rather-be-princess/id492520763?mt=11">Would You Rather Be a Princess or a Dragon</a> (written and illustrated by Barney Saltzberg) It’s a cute story that teaches kids that everyone has a little princess and dragon inside them.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/muddypaws-parragon-read-along/id434449727?mt=11">Muddypaws</a> (by Simon Mendez and Moira Butterfield) I find this story about a boy naming his new puppy a little brain-numbing, but both girls absolutely love it.</p>

<p><strong>From the library:</strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-grace-for-president.jpeg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Giant-Peach-Roald-Dahl/dp/0142410365">James and the Giant Peach</a> (written by Roald Dahl) One of my favorites as a kid turns out to be one of R’s favorites too. Dahl’s characters and dialog are just so vivid and funny.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clink-Kelly-DiPucchio/dp/006192928X">Clink</a> (written by Kelly DiPucchio, illustrated by Matthew Myers) If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a>, you’ll like this story of an old toy robot who finally finds a boy who loves him.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grace-President-Kelly-S-DiPucchio/dp/1423139992">Grace for President</a> (written by Kelly DiPucchio, illustrated by LeUyen Pham) What an inspiring story of how a girl becomes president of her class.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sipping-Spiders-Through-Straw-Campfire/dp/0439584019">Sipping Spiders Through a Straw: Campfire Songs for Monsters</a> (written by Kelly DiPucchio, illustrated by Gris Grimly) Until I wrote this list I didn’t realize how big a part Kelly DiPucchio played in our vacation! Both girls are still singing these crazy songs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-bathing-suits.jpg" /></p>

<p>Learning to walk, talk, or ride a bike are all big milestones in a child&rsquo;s life. We usually remember how old our kids were when they reached them, but the actual point in time is somewhat arbitrary. How many steps is considered walking? When does babbling turn into talking? When do they really have control of the bike?</p>

<p>What isn&rsquo;t arbitrary is that moment when you say to yourself &ldquo;Holy Shit! They&rsquo;re really doing it!&rdquo; R is completely fearless in the water and has always been an enthusiastic splasher. I have to watch her like a hawk any time we&rsquo;re near a pool or at the beach, and I can&rsquo;t count how many times she has over-estimated her abilities and needed a helping hand or a full fledged rescue. She took a short swimming class last summer and learned to hold her breath and go under water, but as far as I could tell there wasn&rsquo;t much actual instruction. This summer she had swimming lessons at camp, but she reported spending most of her time wearing a floaty bubble aroud her waist.</p>

<p>For the past two weeks we&rsquo;ve been on vacation in California, and we&rsquo;ve had some good times playing in the pool and in the surf. Yesterday in the pool R was enjoying climbing on and off a boogie board in the shallow end. When it got away from her and floated to the deep end, she dog-paddled over to get it and kicked her way back. I blinked my eyes a few times and told her I thought she could have made it to the ladder (on the other side of the pool) if she wanted to. She shook her head and said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; but the gears were turning. A few minutes later she just went for it. I swam right next to her. She arrived at the ladder with a big smile on her face. And then swam all the way back. </p>

<p>Holy shit, the girl can swim!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/08/04/poetry-for-kids/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/08/04/poetry-for-kids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I still remember in third grade when my grandmother got me my first book of poetry. I looked at it suspiciously and cast it aside. I don’t think I opened it more than a couple times and I have no idea what happened to it. Much later (as a pretentious young adult), I started taking poetry as seriously as song lyrics, and slowly built up a real appreciation for it.  But even after all these years, it still feels a little like a foreign language.</p>

<p>My theory has always been that I would be fluent in poetry if only it had been a regular part of my life when I was little. In our household we’re testing that theory with the girls by mixing a fair bit of poetry in with our usual large helpings of stories and nature books. So far, it’s going well–The girls think of poems as a completely normal form of expression. I think the key is reading widely, but making sure to hit subjects that the girls already enjoy. Here are some of our favorite collections:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/poems/hv-sharing-the-seasons.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sharing-Seasons-A-Book-Poems/dp/1416902104">Sharing the Seasons: A Book of Poems</a> (collected by Lee Bennett Hopkins, illustrated by David Diaz) These vivid poems are clever and really capture the variety of life across the seasons. This collection is probably the house favorite and R loves to recite this spring poem:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t You Dare” by Beverly McLoughland  </p>

  <p>Stop! cried Robin,<br />
Don’t you dare begin it<br />
Another tweety rhyme<br />
With a redbreast in it.  </p>

  <p>Another cheery verse<br />
With a cherry tree,<br />
Don’t you dare<br />
Write another spring poem about me!  </p>

  <p>Take your pad and pencil<br />
To the reedy bog<br />
When you feel a poem coming–<br />
Think Frog.  </p>
</blockquote>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Book-Flower-Fairies/dp/0723248397">The Complete Book of the Flower Fairies</a> (written and illustrated by Cicely Mary Barker) This collection is incredible and I don’t say that lightly. Ms. Barker is most known for her beautifully detailed drawings, but I think the accompanying poems are just as wonderful. If the flower grows in England, Ms. Barker has almost certainly written about its fairies.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Dandelion Fairy”  by Cicely Mary Barker</p>

  <p>Here’s the Dandelion’s rhyme:<br />
See my leaves with tooth-like edges;<br />
Blow my clocks to tell the time;<br />
See me flaunting by the hedges,<br />
In the meadow, in the lane,<br />
Gay and naughty in the garden;<br />
Pull me up-I grow again,<br />
Asking neither leave nor pardon.<br />
Sillies, what are you about<br />
With your spades and hoes of iron?<br />
You can never drive me out-<br />
Me, the dauntless Dandelion!  </p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Childs-Book-Poems-Gyo-Fujikawa/dp/1402750617">A Child’s Book of Poems</a> (collected and illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa) I’ve been <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2011/12/30/bad-behavior/">a huge fan</a> of Mr. Fujikawa’s pen and ink drawings since I came across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Busy-Day-Gyo-Fujikawa/dp/1402768192">Oh, What a Busy Day</a>. This collection is full of “serious” poetry by the likes of Wordsworth, Blake, Coleridge and Tennyson as well as plenty of silly rhymes by the prolific Anonymous.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rain in Summer” by Henry Wadworth Longfellow  </p>

  <p>How beautiful is the rain!<br />
After the dust and heat,<br />
In the broad and fiery street,<br />
In the narrow lane,<br />
How beautiful is the rain!<br />
How it clatters along the roofs,<br />
Like the tram of hoofs!</p>

  <p>How it gushes and struggles out<br />
From the throat of the overflowing spout!<br />
Across the windowpane<br />
It pours and pours;<br />
And swift and wide,<br />
With a muddy tide,<br />
Like a river down the gutter roars<br />
The rain, the welcome rain!  </p>

It follows a cat on his journey from the shelter to a new home. And as the title says, the author really does tell the story as a series of perfect haiku.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The New Place”</p>

  <p>Deep, dark bed cave. Me?<br />
Hiding? I’m no scaredy cat!<br />
I like dust bunnies!  </p>

Ha. I’ll stay put till I know:<br />
Are they friend…or foe?  </p>

Fine. I’ll come out and chase it<br />

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/28/kbr-eclectic/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/28/kbr-eclectic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The three picture books described below have little in common beyond being very popular in our house. One is a diamond in the rough, another is a fantastic collection of poems, and the third is a quirky reference book. None are new, but one or two might be new to you:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-henrys-happy-birthday.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Henrys-Happy-Birthday-Holly-Keller/dp/0688094511">Henry’s Happy Birthday</a> (written and illustrated by Holly Keller in 1990) The soul of Dick and Jane lives on in a lot of forgettable books in beginning reader series out there. These stories are often so formulaic you wonder why anyone would pick one up when there are so many other great books to choose. We got this book as a hand-me-down and when I saw it was part of the Weekly Reader Children’s Book Club series, I had low expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Henry has a vision for his birthday, and things don’t according to  plan. Among other things, he’s not allowed to wear his favorite t-shirt, his wrapped presents look lame, his cake isn’t chocolate, and he loses in musical chairs. He’s pretty disappointed, but things quickly take a turn for the better when his dad surprises him with a birthday crown and a bunch of balloons. He ends up having a great day. In our household we really value the ability to appreciate the good in situations and having faith that things will work out in the end. This story is terrific at teaching those lessons. The illustrations are definitely not high art, but they are cute and work well with the text.</p>

<p><em>Henry’s Happy Birthday</em> should be required reading the night before any birthdays or highly anticipated play dates.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-bow-wow-meow-meow.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/bow-wow-meow-rhyming-cats/dp/0152163956">Bow wow Meow Meow</a> (written and illustrated by Douglas Florian in 2003)  I’m not sure how I’ve managed to miss out on Douglas Florian all these years, but I sure am happy I found him a few weeks ago at the library. This collection of short poems about dogs and cats is hilarious for all ages. R and B regularly quote “Who always yanks the tail of the manx?” and R memorized all of the amazing opener: “Dog Log”. The illustrations are creative and fun too.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-animals-speak.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Animals-Speak-Lila-Prap/dp/B0046LUKX6">Animals Speak</a> (written and illustrated by Lila Prap in 2006) Ever wonder what horses say in Hungarian or what frogs say in Farsi? Here are your answers. R studied this book for weeks and had lots of fun finding out how her multilingual friends would say neigh, buzz, or meow. The book’s pictures and flags of the world make it much more approachable for kids than <a href="http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Personal/dabbott/animal.html">Derek Abbott’s giant table</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/21/violence-in-picture-books/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/21/violence-in-picture-books</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Violence is rampant in kids’ books. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter">Harry Potter</a> books are filled with magical blades and fierce battles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boys">The Hardy Boys</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Drew">Nancy Drew</a> are dodging bullets and getting bound to chairs in every other chapter. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%27s_Web">Charlotte’s Web</a> starts with a near ax murder. My kids (age 3 and 5) aren’t quite old enough to be reading these books on their own, and we are pretty careful about what we read to them. A while back I wrote about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/06/violence-in-kids-books/">R’s fascination with Greek mythology</a>, but this turned out to be a phase–The closest she gets to violence these days is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Case-Fight-Jigsaw-Jones-Mystery/dp/0439678072">food fight with Jigsaw Jones</a>.</p>

<p>Both girls still spend most of their time in the relatively safe world of picture books. I say <em>relatively</em> safe because occasionally we happen across some surprising brutality. Here are a few examples we’ve happened upon recently:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-millions-of-cats.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millions-Edition-Picture-Puffin-Books/dp/0142407089">Millions of cats</a> (written and illustrated by Wanda Gag in 1928) The illustrations are uniquely beautiful black pen and ink drawings and the story is about a very old man who goes out looking for a cat but has trouble deciding and ends up returning to his wife with millions of potential pets. (This happens to me sometimes when I go grocery shopping hungry, albeit on a smaller scale.) Unfortunately, the story takes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthus">Malthusian</a> turn when the multitude of cats start fighting about who is the prettiest:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>They bit and scratched and clawed each other and made such a great noise that the very old man and the very old woman ran into the house as fast as they could. They did not like such quarreling. But after a while the noise stopped and the very old man and the very old woman peeped out of the window to see what had happened. They could not see a single cat! I think they must have eaten each other all up said the very old woman, “It’s too bad!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too bad indeed! Luckily one kitten who didn’t think he was prettiest survived. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJO3ROT-A4E">One Direction was right</a> when they said “You don’t know you’re beautiful and that’s what makes you beautiful.” Seriously, I loved this book when was a kid and only found the millions of deaths mildly unsettling.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-feathers-and-fools.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feathers-Fools-Mem-Fox/dp/0152023658">Feathers and Fools</a> (written by Mem Fox, illustrated by Nicholas Wilton in 1996) Mem Fox has written some tremendous books, but no matter how you slice it, this book about two flocks of birds who don’t get along is not young-child-appropriate. You might as well just read the latest news stories of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to your kids at bed time:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the swans, seeing them coming, made ready. 
Soon cries filled the air and blood darkened the earth. 
A cloud of feathers rose into the sky and haunted the sun. </p>

  <p>Of all the birds, not one remained alive. 
Silence hung over the gardens. 
And over the the lake. </p>

  <p>Then, in the shadows of the gardens, an egg hatched, and a small bird staggered out into the bloodstained silence. </p>

  <p>Among the reefs beside the lake a second egg hatched, and another small bird teetered out into the ruins </p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-poor-mr-nosey.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Nosey-Men-Little-Miss/dp/0843174781">Mr. Nosey</a> (written and illustrated by Roger Hargreaves in 1971) I’ve written before about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/06/19/mister-men-and-little-misses/">how much I love the Mister Men and Little Misses</a>, but this particular book is one that I actively avoid. Mr. Nosey is just one of many annoying but endearing Mister Men in the series who get their comeuppance. What’s different here is that Mr. Nosey is actually physically abused. Even worse is the pleasure the abusers take in hurting their victim:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BANG” went a hammer right on the end of Mr. Nosey’s nose.</p>

  <p>“Oh dear. I AM sorry!” said old Mr. Chips, who was nailing up a loose plank in the fence.</p>

  <p>Poor Mr. Nosey had to go home immediately and bandage his poor red sore nose.</p>

  <p>Mr. Chips grinned a broad grim.(sic!)</p>

  <p>The Plan was working very well indeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The real world is violent place. Eventually my girls will have to learn this and figure out how to live in it. We’re going to shelter them until we think they’re ready. I don’t know when that will be, but I know it won’t be for a while.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/overcast-review/">whole</a> <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2454285/review-overcast-is-a-winning-podcast-app.html">Internet</a> <a href="http://www.imore.com/overcast-iphone-review-podcasts-reconsidered">seemed</a> <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2014/7/overcast">to</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/07/16/overcast-1">go</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=overcast">crazy</a> today about the release of <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a>’s new podcast app for iOS: <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>. He’s a nerd celebrity and he’s been teasing his fanbase (myself included) for what seems like a year as he worked on it and talked about it. Marco is an accomplished entrepreneur and engineer, and this release was <em>highly</em> anticipated. As a fan and a regular podcast listener, you might think I would be one of his first customers, but you’d be wrong.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-network-podcast-app.jpg" /></p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://networkapp.net">Network</a> for the last six months and am very happy. The UI couldn’t have less chrome–All you see in the app is the artwork from your podcasts, episode descriptions, and a plus sign for adding new podcasts. Your interaction with the app is almost entirely through gestures. It’s not <em>completely</em> intuitive, but it makes me smile and reminds me a lot of the <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/clear">Clear</a> to-do and reminders app.</p>

<p><a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Instacast</a>, <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com">Downcast</a>, <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts">Pocket Casts</a> and now Overcast all have a lot more features than Network, but I don’t need a lot of features and I certainly don’t want to fiddle with my podcast app while I choose avocadoes and listen to <a href="http://atp.fm">John Siracusa</a> complain about LCD TV’s. Some of Overcast’s features (e.g., Smart Speed) do sound cool and non-intrusive, but for now Network is perfect for me–It plays my podcasts and just melts into the background.</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/14/monday-reading</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it turns out there are <a href="http://www.teachmentortexts.com/2014/07/its-monday-what-are-you-reading-71414_13.html#axzz37V4D0PXw">people out on the Internet</a> out on the Internet besides me that read and review picture books! Not only that, a whole bunch of them gather on Mondays to share their latest favorites. I guess this has something to do with this “social media” thing that is so trendy these days. Sigh, I feel so old.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the three books in heavy rotation on right now with my three year-old that I love:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-alexander.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0590430122">Alexander and the Wind-up Mouse</a> (written and illustrated by Leo Lionni) I’ve written about <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/">my love for Leo Lionni</a> before and this is my personal favorite. It’s got magic lizards, beautiful artwork, and the last page brings a tear to my eye every time I read it. The amazing thing is that my three year old seems to love it just as much as I do.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-norman.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norman-Doorman-Picture-Puffins-Freeman/dp/0140502882">Norman the Doorman</a> (written and illustrated by Don Freeman) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corduroy-Don-Freeman/dp/0140501738">Corduroy</a> gets more attention, but Don Freeman was far from a one-trick pony. This book about a mouse that works at a museum by day and creates art at night is lovely story with a sweet message.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-zack.jpeg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zacks-Alligator-Can-Read-Book/dp/0064441865">Zack’s Alligator</a> (written by Shirley Mozelle and illustrated by James Watts) This story is pure fun and I’ve never met a kid who wouldn’t do anything to have Zack’s alligator keychain. It’s like reading a smarter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Danny-Dinosaur-Syd-Hoff/dp/0064440028">Danny and the Dinosaur</a> with a strong female lead character. </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/03/tile-a-geek-love-story/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/07/03/tile-a-geek-love-story</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I got this email:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-tile-request.png" /></p>

<p>Indeed, I have a story, but I doubt it will be on Tile’s front page anytime soon. <!--More--> It started almost a year ago when I backed my very first <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> project and ordered four Tiles. These magical one inch squares promised to keep me from ever losing anything ever again. I immediately envisioned attaching them to my keys, my wife’s keys, our wallets, and my daughters’ favorite toys. And I knew once I had them in my hands I would think of a host of new possibilities. I was in geek love. </p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-tile.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Each $18.95 tile was a tiny Bluetooth beacon that could talk to any phone nearby that had the Tile app installed. If my keys fell behind a couch cushion, my phone could make their Tile play a little song announcing where they were. If I accidentally dropped my keys in the bushes, the app would remember where it last saw them and show me on a map. And if I left them on a plane, my app would talk to Tile’s cloud servers and let me know when another Tile user went near them and show me their location. The project had already hit it’s funding goal and was rocketing toward production. I couldn’t wait to get my delivery!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-tile-key-basket.jpg" /></p>

<p>Months passed as the Tile Team worked through a series of last minute issues, and my interest started to wane. Then I realized that the batteries inside the Tiles expire after a year and are un-replaceable. That is, you have to buy new Tiles every year when your old ones die. And by the time my Tiles finally arrived, I realized that I already had a pretty good system for keeping track of my keys: They are always either in my pocket or in our kitchen key basket. I haven’t lost track of my keys in years. The same goes for my wallet, and even if I were a chronic wallet-loser, the Tile turns out to be too thick to comfortably slide into it.</p>

<p>Many of my early relationships followed the same pattern: Fall deeply in something with someone that was half a creation of my imagination. As I realized that this person was flesh and blood with flaws and features I didn’t immediately appreciate, I walked away. It wasn’t until much later that I learned that you can’t really love anyone without first understanding that there are no ideal types. You have to recognize that everyone is at least a little messy on the inside and the outside.</p>

<p>After a week with my Tiles, I’m starting to appreciate them. On Saturday my wife lost her keys and we spent several minutes scouring the house before we found them. I quickly attached a Tile, and that shouldn’t happen again. I’m also excited to put one in the car and always know where I’ve parked. Less than $20 for a  bit of magic is actually a pretty good deal even if it doesn’t last more than a year. And imagine how much cooler the next version will be!</p>
