    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>B is really into robots lately, and I thought it would be fun to share her favorite books that feature robots or have exciting robot-related scenes.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-robot-and-bluebird.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Robot-Bluebird-David-Lucas/dp/0374363307">The Robot and the Bluebird</a> (written and illustrated by David Lucas) This is a sweet story that takes on some heavy topics: love, sacrifice and even death. Spoiler alert: The bird comes out ok at the end, the robot not so much. The quirky drawings are wonderful, and honestly I think David Lucas is physically incapable of creating a book that’s not great.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-boy-+-bot.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Bot-Ame-Dyckman/dp/0375867562">Boy + Bot</a> (written by Ame Dyckman, illustrated by Dan Yaccarino) We picked this up at the library a couple weeks ago and it’s still B’s dinner time favorite. The boy and the robot meet in the forest and start a friendship that’s briefly interrupted by a couple cute misunderstandings. Now whenever I ask B if she likes this book she smiles and says in a slow monotone: “Affirmative.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-lbg-mean-robot.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladybug-Girl-Bumblebee-Jacky-Davis/dp/0803733399">Ladybug Girl and Bumblebee Boy</a> (written by Jacky Davis, illustrated by David Soman) This is our go-to bedtime book and it’s got Ladybug Girl playing Bug Squad at the playground with her new friend Sam. B loves when they pretend the tire swing is a mean robot and Lulu jumps on its head. And the other day at the playground we almost convinced a real boy to play Ladybug Bug girl with us! He wanted to be Mosquito Boy until his friend pulled him back to playing Ninjas.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-critter-giant-robot.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Just Go to Bed</a> (written and illustrated by Mercer Mayer) The Critter books are like cheese sandwiches–they aren’t the most creative stories, but they are consistently good. I might appreciate this one more than the girls because we live it almost every night. Critter keeps coming up with excuses for not going to bed while his parents play along but get more and more exasperated. At  one point Critter is a space cadet and Dad (the giant robot) captures him. If only that were the end of the story.</li>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/19/wawa/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/19/wawa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-wawa.jpg" /></p>

<p>I recently made a quick return visit to Philadelphia and rediscovered one of my favorite Philly institutions. It wasn&rsquo;t the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_bell">Liberty Bell</a>, the <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/music-art/philadelphia/love-statue/">Love sculpture</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/06/tetris-skyscraper_n_5099208.html">giant tetris tower</a>. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawa,_Inc.">Wawa</a>: the world&rsquo;s greatest convenience store. What makes it so much better than 7-Eleven, ampm, or even the recently departed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Hen">White Hen</a>? Two things:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
  <li>Wawa has the high tech efficiency of a Japanese factory. They do everything they can possibly think of to get you exactly what you want as fast as possible. When you want a fresh sandwich (or bagel or breakfast burrito or anything else that needs preparation) you don&rsquo;t wait in line and talk to an error prone human. Instead, you tap your way through a perfectly designed touch screen interface and when you finish, your receipt is instantly printed. While you pay for your order (and anything else), they make your food. Wawa is always packed, but no one is ever waiting for anything.</li>
  <li>Wawa has their finger on the pulse of America. Do Americans want roller hot dogs or stale donuts? No! We want fresh baked goods and 10 flavors of fresh-brewed coffee. Do we want two choices for liquid additives for our coffee? No! We want to choose between skim, 1%, 2%, whole, half-and-half, full-on-cream, and three different non-dairy creamers. And they all better be on ice. Wawa is on the cutting edge of smoothies and fancy iced coffee drinks too. At the same time, they&rsquo;ve got a great selection of sodas, candy, and medicine.</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit I&rsquo;m a little biased. My three-year-old and I enjoyed playing find the &ldquo;Wawa&rdquo; in the store (not a hard game given the number of self-branded items) while listening to a continuous stream of 80&rsquo;s music (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXu6QmxpJE">Everybody Wang Chung Tonight!</a>). Even so, I&rsquo;m perplexed. Why is America outside of Philadelphia almost completely deprived of the Wawa experience? It made sense before 2008 when the Phillies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_World_Series">won the World Series</a> and the city needed <em>something</em> to be proud of. But now? Nothing should be stopping Wawa from total world domination.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing the Right Tool for the Job]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/09/the-right-tool/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/05/09/the-right-tool</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-tools.jpg" /></p>

<p>Every new programming project involves choosing a language early in the process. This choice can be exciting and daunting at the same time, as it always involves weighing several conflicting factors. Based on many years of varied programming experience, here is my advice:</p>

<!--More-->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pick a language appropriate to the task. Do you need good numerical optimization libraries? Do you need matrix operations? Do you need to parse HTML files? You don&rsquo;t need the best language, but you don&rsquo;t want to be stuck with something too slow or that requires you to write a lot of unnecessary support code. This is what John D. Cook is getting at when he says <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/03/12/dont-be-a-technical-masochist/">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a technical masochist&rdquo;</a>. I always think of this first even though it&rsquo;s not always the most important criterion. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take into account the fact that you might have to learn (or relearn) the language. This is the dreaded learning curve and even though I&rsquo;m a quick learner, I always underestimate the time it takes to achieve proficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think about the future utility of knowing the language. This is harder than it looks. On the one hand Python is broadly popular and winning in scientific computing. Ruby is a similar language but has better libraries for web development. Both seem like good investments, but I haven&rsquo;t used Python in more than 5 years and I&rsquo;ve never written anything in Ruby. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are collaborating, think about what the rest of the team knows. Even if your partner isn&rsquo;t writing as much code as you, it&rsquo;s pretty valuable if they can read your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget to have fun. Programming can be a grind&ndash;sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to stretch your brain with something new. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expertise in a language should not be squandered. It&rsquo;s a lot of work pouring the core of a language (and it&rsquo;s standard libraries) into your head, but once you do it, you can write a lot of good code very quickly. This knowledge depreciates quickly when you switch to different &ldquo;better&rdquo; tools for a given job.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I spend a fair amount of my time analyzing data with <a href="http://www.stata.com">Stata</a>, and that involves writing programs in a quirky proprietary language. For example, it has no variables, but it does have local and global macros. To evaluate a local macro, you surround its name with a back quote and a forward quote (`x&rsquo;). These can be nested. Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign ($x). That said, it has general file handling and regular expression functions, and you can do interesting programming with it.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been trying to maintain and build my expertise in Stata by using it for a broad range of programming tasks even when it&rsquo;s not the objectively best tool for a job. That was the case a few months ago when I parsed up and analyzed the content on this site. The end result looks a little weird, but it works and my brain is in a better place for it:</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Irish Pride]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/26/irish-pride/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/26/irish-pride</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/?p=691"><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-primordial.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I grew up outside Boston surrounded by Irish-American kids named Sully and Patrick. Even though my last name was McKee, I was different. I was told that my ancestors were MacKays from Scotland who migrated to Ireland and changed their name to McKee to avoid discrimination. I read Scottish folk tales, fantasized about competing in the Highland Games, and seriously considered getting a kilt. I tracked down my tartan, and as a young adult toured Scottish castles and got lost in the moors on my mountain bike. I know this sounds ridiculous coming from a suburban American kid, but Scotland felt like home.
<!--more-->
Then when I was about 30 I told my dad this story and he just laughed. It turns out while one of my distant relatives was indeed Scottish, the rest of his side of the family was full-blooded Irish. I couldn’t believe it. I like U2’s early work as much as the next guy, but suddenly I was supposed to embrace St. Patrick’s Day, leprechauns, and the color green? </p>

<p>In the years since, I’ve tried to have an open mind and learn more about my new homeland. It hasn’t come naturally, but I am happy to report that I’ve found a band that seems to have kindled a little bit of Irish pride in me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_(band)">Primordial</a> was founded in 1987 near Dublin and has released seven albums that are an incredible mixture of epic black metal and Irish folk music. While the instruments are not traditional, many of the melodies are. The lyrics range from wild fantasy to Irish history. The singer (Alan Averil) is amazing–you feel exactly what he’s feeling.</p>

<p>I found Primordial through the <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem">Requiem Metal Podcast</a> where you can listen to a <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/?p=691">two</a> <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/?p=704">part</a> episode about the band and hear several of their songs. They have truly unique sound that really speaks to me. Maybe I’ll wear green tomorrow.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/18/crucial-years-in-metal-1983</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-shout-at-the-devil.jpg" /></p>

<p>Late at night, as I putter around the house folding laundry or washing dishes or putting away toys, I often listen to podcasts. Most are mainstream. For sports, I listen to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2864045">BS Report</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/grantland-nfl-podcast/id730254718?mt=2">Grantland NFL</a>; for tech stuff, I listen to <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>; and for real life, I like <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a> and <a href="http://dadsbeingdads.net">Dads Being Dads</a>.</p>

<p>My current favorite podcast, however, is not mainstream. The <a href="http://cvcomics.com/requiem/">Requiem Metal Podcast</a> features two guys (Mark Rudolph and Jason Hundey) playing and talking about their favorite extreme metal. They started broadcasting in 2008 and have since produced 170 episodes. Every one stands on its own and I’ve had great fun digging into their back catalog to learn more about bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_(band)">Emperor</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_thrower">Bolt Thrower</a>.</p>

<p>In their lead up to episode 100, they profiled what they considered the 10 most “crucial” years in metal. These are years that had not just great album releases, but albums that had a big impact on the future of the whole heavy metal genre. Even though Mark and Jason were little kids in the 80’s, they definitely appreciate them in hindsight, and their top 10 includes 4 years from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_Decadence_81-91">decade</a>: 1984 (#5), 1985 (#10), 1988 (#9), and 1989 (#1).</p>

<p>I attended high school from 1982 to 1986 and listened to a tremendous amount of metal during that time. I started with hard rock, moved into glam/hair, expanded into classic metal, and loved exploring thrash and the beginnings of extreme metal. My friend Mike and I used to hang out at our local independent record store (Rockin’ Mania) and flip through whatever new (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal">Nü</a>) metal came in each week. If the cover looked interesting one of us (usually Mike) would buy it. That’s how we discovered Metallica’s <em>Ride the Lightning</em>, Mercyful Fate’s <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, and the amazing Best of Metal Blade compilation albums.</p>

<p>I know I’m biased because 1983 was a particularly crucial year in metal for me, but three very important albums in the history of metal did come out that year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Kill em all</em> (Metallica). This was the first album by the biggest metal band of all time. It’s not as good as their next two, but it’s one of the first pure thrash records and it rocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Shout at the Devil</em> (Motley Crüe) I still remember seeing the album cover in a mall with my mom and being simultaneously scared, repulsed and intrigued. The <a href="http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/motleycrue/shoutatthedevil.html#1">first song on the album</a> is a weird Satanic-ish sermon (that I can still quote verbatim) and the music is surprisingly heavy for people who think of the Crüe as that band who sang “Girls Girls Girls” and “Home Sweet Home”. For tons of kids like me, this album was a powerful gateway into the world of real metal. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Melissa</em> (Mercyful Fate) Many people have written about how influential this band was on the development of the black metal genre, and extreme metal in general, but on the podcast, Mark often disparages Mercyful Fate by calling them “goofy” or “circus metal”. I’m here to tell you it didn’t come off that way <strong>at all</strong> back in the day. When my friend Mike bought their second album (<em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>) on a whim, we were completely creeped out the first time he played it. We just didn’t know what to do with the blasphemous lyrics, shreiking vocals, and unbelievably catchy guitar work. I had a copy on cassette which I ended up listening to a few times and then throwing in the trash. Mike did the same thing with his album–it’s like we thought we were destined to burn in hell if we kept them. Now, a little older and wiser we can appreciate the music and laugh at the lyrics. <em>Melissa</em>, their first album, isn’t as good as <em>Don’t Break the Oath</em>, but you can’t have a second without a first.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After high school, I moved away from home and away from metal. When hair metal disappeared from the radio, I thought metal itself  had died. In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s I knew Nü Metal was a thing, but only dabbled a bit with bands like Korn, Disturbed, and even Linkin Park. Later in the 2000’s I learned that music called black metal and death metal existed, but extreme metal can be an acquired taste and I just wasn’t ready. Now, with Mark and Jason’s help, I’m really enjoying filling in the huge gaps in my metal education.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/04/04/black-metal-for-kids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Black metal is nasty stuff. Most of it revolves around Satanic imagery, shreiking vocals and guitars, incredibly fast “blast beat” drums, and spooky low fi production. Most bands hail from Scandinavia, and in the mid 90’s the nastiness reached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Satanic-Underground-Edition/dp/0922915946">particularly nasty level</a> as bands competed with each other to see who was the most evil by burning churches and murdering each other. And yet, I really appreciate the dark moodiness and musicality.</p>

<p>You can imagine my surprise when I found an honest-to-goodness Norwegian black metal band that is perfect for kids and adults. Now, whenever we get in the car, my two year old requests their music and proceeds to laugh and sing along! How did this happen? A confluence of two amazing things.</p>

<p>As I’ve already reported, <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/21/fun-and-games-at-the-library/">my girls love the Rainbow Magic books</a>. While the heros are Kirsty, Rachel, and the fairies, the villains are Jack Frost and the goblins. Their home is an icy castle north of Fairy Land and they are frankly hilarious. The goblins call each other names, trip over each other, and are some of the least scary “monsters” you’ll ever meet. I remember in one book Rachel and Kirsty got their way by tickling the goblins.</p>

<p>The band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_(band)">Immortal</a> has been recording black metal since before their first full-length release: <em>Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism</em> in 1992. Their music is classic black metal, but many of their songs simply describe frigid mountains and the grumpy king who reigns over them. B’s favorite song is “Mountains of Might.” It starts with organ which B says is “carousel music” and contains vocals which she calls “a goblin talking:”</p>

<pre><code>The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
The winds are everblowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descend of the valley
Into the high impassable drifts
So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Forever standing here
These mountains northern face
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Icicled peeks as far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there
The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
</code></pre>

<p>The acoustic break in the middle is when “the goblins are dancing.” The whole album (<em>Blizzard Beasts</em>) is recorded with the vocals mixed extra loud so they don’t get lost. My favorite part is how Abbath (the lead singer) pronounces glaciers as “glaysseers”. The <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/antarctica-lyrics-immortal.html">lyrics of “Antarctica”</a> (from <em>Sons of Northern Darkness</em>) are similarly child-friendly and the music is similarly goblin-friendly.</p>

<p>The only downside to Immortal for kids is common to all heavy metal: the terribly inappropriate music videos. Immortal follows black metal tradition and performs in corpse paint while making lots of scary faces. They also seem to love weird spiked bondage gear. They look ridiculous and I try to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VBdAY8eA9w">their videos</a> too. It doesn’t have to be this way. Consider the video below to be my small contribution to making the world a better place:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-dead-fish.jpg" /></p>

<p>Spring has finally arrived in Connecticut. The snow is gone, replaced by snowdrops and crocuses, and the birds have returned. We&rsquo;ve had great fun watching robins, bluejays, and red-winged blackbirds pulling on worms and building nests, and hearing their songs fill the air. </p>

<p>On the way home from school the other day we got an extra-special treat. As we drove by the reservoir, two hawks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> flew over the car fighting over something. The birds were big and their prey was big too. The hawks dipped and dove and then lost control of their prize, letting it fall right into the street in front of us. </p>

<p>When it bounced and rolled to a stop we saw it was a huge fish!  The whole rest of our trip home we wondered if the fish would still be there the next day and since it was a pretty busy street, hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t see a road-killed hawk (or two) lying near by.</p>

<p>The next morning we were never so happy to see a dead fish all alone by the side of the road. We had to pull over so everyone could get out to take a closer look. Whoever said bird watching was boring?</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Maybe they were ospreys, but we get a lot of red-tailed hawks around here and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk#Diet">Wikipedia</a> says they do occasionally eat fish.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Consumption, analysis, and <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/">creation</a>. A lot of my time can be assigned to one of these three categories, and while all three have their place, I find it very easy to slouch into consumption and shirk creation. I feel better about myself when I&rsquo;m in balance, so I&rsquo;m always looking for opportunities to make things. That&rsquo;s one reason the girls and I have been making up so <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/03/12/pretty-pretty-princess/">many</a> <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/21/non-violent-dungeons-and-dragons-for-kids/">new</a> <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/12/17/sequence-for-kids/">games</a> lately. </p>

<p>Our trips to the library have always been more than simply dropping off and picking up bags of books. We like to take our time and hang out too. These are our three favorite games to play while we&rsquo;re there:</p>

<p><strong>1. The Rug Game:</strong> The main branch of the New Haven Free Public Library has a huge children&rsquo;s room and in the middle is a big circular rug with the alphabet and associated pictures printed around the edge. Since R was little we&rsquo;ve played a game where I tell her to find something and she has to run to an appropriate letter. We started with the basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run to the octopus!</li>
  <li>Where is the dog?</li>
  <li>Find the birthday cake!</li>
</ul>

<p>We moved on to more tricky questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What keeps you dry in the rain? (Umbrella)</li>
  <li>Who has 8 arms? (Octopus)</li>
  <li>Find a red fruit! (Apple)</li>
</ul>

<p>When other kids join in, the questions have to have at least two correct answers so everyone can find their own letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who swims in the water? (Fish, octopus, turtle)</li>
  <li>Find a fun toy! (yoyo, kite)</li>
  <li>What has a shell? (Turtle, egg)</li>
</ul>

<p>As the kids get older, the questions get downright tricky:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What rhymes with cry? (Pie)</li>
  <li>Who has a princess for a daughter? (Queen)</li>
  <li>Who is black and white? (Zebra)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Rainbow Magic:</strong> R is currently obsessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Magic">this series</a> of beginning chapter books. They are formulaic in the same way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_the_Explorer">Dora and Boots</a> are formulaic beginning readers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boys">The Hardy Boys</a> are formulaic tween boy schlock. The books come in sets of seven (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545175178/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0545175178&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=highvari-20">The Pet Fairies</a>) and each book involves two girls (Rachel and Kirsty) helping a particular fairy retrieve some magic item before Jack Frost and/or his goblins can get it. The books are quite harmless, and the thing is kids <em>like</em> formula&ndash;figuring it out is like solving a puzzle. B is not so into the stories yet, but she&rsquo;s been swept up in R&rsquo;s enthusiasm, and at the library she loves to gather up a big pile of the books, pore over the covers, and flip for pictures of goblins. We recently made up a game where she files her books by the first letter of the fairy&rsquo;s name on the alphabet rug. Fun and even a little educational!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-picture-book-scavenger-hunt.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>3. Picture Book Scavenger Hunt:</strong> This is a game I&rsquo;ve been trying to get the girls excited about for years, and during our last library outing it finally took hold. I made a list of animals, characters and objects, and the girls had to find a picture of each in a book. We settled in between two big shelves and started digging. It was surprisingly difficult&ndash;I would have told you that a third of all picture books contain princesses, fairies, pirates, and dogs. It turns out dogs are easy to find, but everything else took a little hunting. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a lot recently about games we&rsquo;ve made up and had a good time playing. I hope some of you are inspired to try a few out. I hope even more that you are inspired to create your own games. That&rsquo;s the most fun of all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-pretty-pretty-princess.jpg" /></p>

<p>I was talking to one of R&rsquo;s former pre-school teachers the other day, and she mentioned a board game she used to play with her daughter and husband called <em>Pretty Pretty Princess</em>. It involved moving pieces around the board (ala Candy Land) and collecting real jewelry that you get to wear. You win when you put on the tiara and shout out &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Pretty Pretty Princess!&rdquo; My first thought was that both of my girls would love this game and I should look for it on Amazon as soon as possible.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> My second thought was that we already owned most of the parts and it would be even more fun to make the game ourselves.</p>

<p>We started by rolling out a big piece of paper and taping it to the dining room table. I drew a winding track and divided it into spaces. The girls went to town with their markers and drew bracelets, necklaces, rings, and earrings all over the board while I tracked down some dice (<a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2013/11/21/non-violent-dungeons-and-dragons-for-kids/">not hard</a>) and our tiaras. We selected our game pieces from our bag of <a href="http://www.schleich-s.com/en/US/toys/">Schleich animals</a> and My Little Ponies, grabbed our kids&rsquo; jewelry box, and started playing.</p>

<p>Rolling the dice and moving her piece the right number of spaces were challenges for B (not quite three years old), but picking jewelry out of the box made it all worthwhile. R enjoyed the game even though the pace was a little bit slow. We&rsquo;ll play this version a few more times, but I&rsquo;m already looking forward to making it more complicated by adding forks in the road, special squares, and some weird rules. </p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I did eventually look up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWHP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000IWHP&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=highvari-20">the game on Amazon</a> and it doesn&rsquo;t look any more fun than our homemade version.  And holy mackerel, it&rsquo;s $99!<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a rough winter filled with snow days and sickness and not enough sleep. Tonight the wind is howling and the temperature is supposed to drop to the single digits. To get us in the mood for spring, the girls and I hunkered down in front of YouTube to hear Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the My Little Ponies sing “Winter Wrap-up”.</p>

<!--- My Little Pony: "Winter Wrap-up
--->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://highvariance.net//www.youtube.com/embed/dyrAkwJ6WsY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the video, the ponies are also tired of winter and are preparing for spring. Actually, scratch that, they aren’t getting ready for spring–they have decided it’s time for spring and they are physically bringing it into being. The Pegasus ponies are annihilating the storm clouds and removing the snow from roofs and trees. Apple Jack and the other earth ponies are plowing the snow off the fields and lakes, and planting seeds. Fluttershy is waking up all the hibernating animals with a little bell. That’s when it hit me: These ponies are not mere cartoon characters at all–They’re gods!</p>

<p>The rulers of Equestria (Princess Celestia and Princess Luna) are obviously the old gods of the Sun and Moon. I’m surprised they aren’t named Princess <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">Ra</a> and Princess <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khonsu">Khonsu</a>. It also turns out each of the <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Characters#Main_characters">Mane Six</a> ponies has a clear analog in Greek mythology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twilight Sparkle is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena">Athena</a>, Goddess of Wisdom. </li>
  <li>Pinkie Pie is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, God of ritual madness and ecstasy–aka partying.</li>
  <li>Rainbow Dash is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes">Hermes</a>–the winged messenger of the gods who is quick and cunning and patron of athletics and sports.</li>
  <li>Apple Jack is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter">Demeter</a>, Goddess of the Harvest.</li>
  <li>Rarity is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, Goddess of Beauty and Love.</li>
  <li>Fluttershy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis">Artemis</a>, Protector of the Animals.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think spring had better come soon before I go completely insane.</p>

<p>Hurry up ponies!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/02/14/stat-nerd-trivia/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/02/14/stat-nerd-trivia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve recently learned three bits of trivia that only a statistics nerd could love. They won’t help you think deeply about data. They won’t help you analyze data. In fact, they’ll probably push useful knowledge out of your head and make you dumber. Read further at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>1. Where does the word “logit” come from?</strong></p>

<p>One of the earliest probablistic models of a binary process is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit">probit</a>. It was developed by Chester Bliss in 1934, and in this paper he coined the term as a shortening of the phrase “probability unit”. The idea is that a one unit increase in an independent variable changes the probability of the outcome occurring by a constant number of probability units. Probits can be translated into actual probabilities using a particular non-linear transformation: the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal. That is, we have:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\Pr(y_i) = \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)
</script>

<p>In 1944, Joseph Berkson developed a similar model that also mapped the real line to the (0,1) interval, this time using the logistic function:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\Pr(y_i) = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)}
</script>

<p>By analogy, this model was given the name logit.</p>

<p><strong>2. Why does Stata store dates as the number of days since January 1, 1960?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/geography/staff/geogstaffhidden/?id=335">Nick Cox</a> knows a lot about <a href="http://www.stata.com">Stata</a>, and even he does not know exactly why this date was chosen as the origin for internal dates. His <a href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2003-08/msg00379.html">best guess</a> is that it was copied from “some data base or spreadsheet program”. My guess is that Stata copied SAS which uses the same date as the date-time origin. </p>

<p>This led me to wonder why SAS chose the date, and Derek Morgan (in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s1h94CZjGCEC&amp;pg=PA2">The Essential Guide to SAS Dates and Times</a>) says “One story has it that the founders of SAS wanted to use the approximate birth date of the IBM 370 system, and they chose January 1, 1960 as an easy-to-remember approximation.” According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(reference_date)#Notable_epoch_dates_in_computing">Wikipedia</a> S-Plus also uses the same reference date.</p>

<p><strong>3. How are we supposed to pronounce McNemar’s test?</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you have a set of matched pairs of observations and want to know if the distribution of some categorical outcome is the same for each side of the pair. You should use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar_test">McNemar’s test</a> to see if the observed differences are statistically significant.
I went years pronouncing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_McNemar">Quinn McNemar</a>’s name as “mik-nee’-mahr” and getting likely getting laughed at behind my back by biostatisticians. It turns out the <a href="http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=90653">proper pronunciation</a> is “mak’ne-mahr”. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax265c6pqvA">Ashwini Kalantri</a> pronounces it well as he explains how it works.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pretty math equations are rendered with <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">Mathjax</a> and integrating this with Javascript was trivial thanks to <a href="http://www.lucypark.kr/blog/2013/02/25/mathjax-kramdown-and-octopress/">Lucy Park</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[My Second Blogoversary]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/02/13/my-second-blogoversary/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/02/13/my-second-blogoversary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past few weeks this blog has achieved two big milestones: December 21 marked the second anniversary of <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2011/12/21/first-post/">my first post</a>, and on December 30, I published my 100th article. To mark the occasion, I thought it would be fun to reflect on the past two years quantitatively.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/22/happy-blogoversary/">2012</a>, I published 54 articles with 29,699 words, and in 2013, I posted 44 articles with 27,938 words–a decline, but not a major one. The average length of an article went up (550 words vs. 635 words) as did the standard deviation of the word count per article (296 words vs. 394 words). The increasing variance on this dimension can be seen visually in these two overlaid histograms:</p>

<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/analyze-2014-02-09/wchist.png" /></p>

<p>So is this blog high variance in article length? That’s hard to say without scraping a bunch of other blogs and analyzing the data. <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/how-i-write/">Matt Gemmell</a> says the distribution of his article lengths is bimodal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I’m not writing to a count, I have two natural lengths of piece:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>700 to 1,000 words for a compact exposition on a topic. This is also an ideal bite-sized chunk of text for the reader, and fits well on a single page. It’s no coincidence that the majority of commissioned magazine pieces fall into this band.</li>
    <li>2,000 to 3,500 words for a more detailed exploration or discussion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The zone between the two is a death march.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I seem to have one natural length, but its range is a bit broader than Matt’s shorter pieces, as only half my articles fall within 369 and 724 words. If you include Matt’s longer pieces, he clearly wears the higher variance crown.</p>

<p>The yearly numbers mask an interesting monthly pattern. While I wrote a little less in 2013, I was more consistent in my output during the year. In both years I started strong, gradually slowed down, and then picked up the pace again in the fall:</p>

<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/analyze-2014-02-09/ac.png" />
<img src="http://highvariance.net/images/analyze-2014-02-09/wc.png" /></p>

<p>Most article content seems to have settled into a small set of categories (<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/tech/">tech</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/kids/">kids</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/education/">education</a>, and <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/music/">music</a>. You could even make an argument that you’re reading a mixture of four distinct extremely low-traffic blogs with the occasional off-the-wall post thrown in. The below picture shows article counts by tag for each year for each tag that had more than one article. Many articles are tagged more than one way and every article I’ve published had at least one of the tags shown below. I wrote a bit more about education and Conan in 2013 and a bit less about music, but I’m not sure those trends will continue in 2014.</p>

<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/analyze-2014-02-09/tags.png" /></p>

<p>On the demand side, High Variance had 8,504 unique visitors in 2013 (up from 2,017) and 13,809 page views (up from 4,000). Chris Blattmann <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2013/04/18/links-i-liked-220/">pointed his firehose my way</a> in mid-April, but even if I ignore that week (961 unique visitors and 1,578 page views), readership is still way up for the year.</p>

<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/analyze-2014-02-09/traffic-2013.png" /></p>

<p>To celebrate, I’ve made a few minor tweeks to the site. First, I’ve added an <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> rule that tweets every time I post something new. You can follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=HighVarianceNet">HighVarianceNet</a>. Second, I’ve made it easier to share content on the site by adding links for tweeting articles and sharing them on Facebook. Third, I’ve signed up as an <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/main.html">Amazon associate</a>. That means if you follow a link from this site to Amazon and then buy the product, you’ll pay the same price but I’ll get a few cents. Maybe by the end of next year I’ll be able to celebrate with a free cup of coffee.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/01/30/exploiting-irrationality</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-floss.png" /></p>

<p>When I was growing up, none of the several clocks in the house told the correct time. My mother would set them all between 5 and 30 minutes fast in an effort to fool herself into leaving the house when she was supposed to. I thought this was completely insane. Why not just wake up early enough to do what you needed to do, and then do that? Why play these games with yourself when pure rationality would suffice?</p>

<p>The answer (of course) is that my mother is far from completely rational, and this system worked for her in a way that my proposed system just didn&rsquo;t. And while I like to think that I&rsquo;m not as crazy as my mother, I&rsquo;m not an automaton either. It&rsquo;s taken me a long time to give in to that and start exploiting some of my foibles for good.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I read <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2085007/the-iphone-habit-apps-that-help-you-keep-your-new-years-resolutions.html">an article</a> by my productivity sensei (<a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks</a>) where he recommended an iPhone app called <a href="http://habitlist.com">Habit List</a> for folks trying to kickstart good habits. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit">some scientific research</a> that says if you can somehow get yourself to do something regularly for a few weeks, it becomes a lot easier to continue doing it. There&rsquo;s also some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Crush">evidence</a> that games can be addictive. In a nutshell, Habit List makes doing mundane things into a game. By the time you&rsquo;re bored with the game, the habit has been formed.</p>

<p>Since I installed Habit List, I&rsquo;ve managed to floss every day except one (thanks stomach flu!). My exercise program has been less successful, but that&rsquo;s more the fault of the cold weather and that same stomach flu than a failure of the app. You can bet that I&rsquo;ll be plugging in some more easy-to-ignore-but-good-for-me chores soon.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2014/01/19/complementarities-of-literature-and-music</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some things just go well together. I have friends who like to select <a href="http://winefolly.com/tutorial/wine-with-fish-pairing-guide/">just the right wine</a> to go with their meal. Cookies always taste better with <a href="http://www.gotmilk.com">milk</a>. And of course a PB&amp;J sandwich is much better than a plain peanut butter sandwich or a plain jam sandwich. Economists are good at coming up with fancy names for obvious concepts, and we call these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good">complementary goods</a>.</p>

<p>Just because I don’t listen to music while I read doesn’t mean this idea can’t be applied to literature and music. Some <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/category-songs_inspired_by_books.php">songs</a> or albums are inspired by good books, and listening to one makes you appreciate the other that much more. Even better is when a musician or band’s work creates a mood that perfectly matches an author’s vision. I’ve recently found the perfect example.</p>

<p>As regular readers of this site know, I am a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E_Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian">Conan</a> stories. Conan himself is strong, principled, and fun-loving. He does all the things we want to do but are unable to because of either physical, legal, or sometimes moral constraints. To read Conan’s savage adventures is to be immersed in a fantastic and vividly portrayed land of magic and mayhem.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon_Amarth">Amon Amarth</a> is the white wine to Conan’s fish. They are a Swedish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_death_metal">melodic death metal</a> band whose songs are rich and powerful tales of battles between mortals and gods of the north. The drums, guitars, and vocals are fierce–just like Conan. Listening to their music on headphones is the perfect way to make a winter trip to the grocery store into an epic quest for sustenance. The fact is that words cannot do them justice. I hereby present to you the truly awesome Amon Amarth: </p>

<!--- Amon Amarth, "Twilight of the Thunder God"
