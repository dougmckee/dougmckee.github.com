    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://highvariance.net/images/hv-trains.jpg" alt="Fisher-Price Geotrax…and a few fairies…OK, a lot of fairies" /></p>

<p>When I was a kid, a big part of the Christmas season was visiting my grandmother and immediately racing down to her basement to run the trains around the track.  I loved the big styrofoam mountain, the rumbling of the engine on the metal tracks, and the feeling of industrial omnipotence when holding the controls in my hand.  </p>

<p>Now that I have my own kids, I want them to have fun with trains during the holidays too.  But my kids are little and a big <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lionel-Pennsylvania-Flyer-Freight-Train/dp/B004L3IKQI">Lionel rig</a> isn’t good match yet.  Traditional train sets are expensive, delicate, and a ton of work to set up.  And I don’t feel good about having toddlers poking around in the miles of requisite electric wiring.</p>

<p>Last year my brother and sister-in-law sent us their old <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/brands/geotrax/index.html">Fisher Price Geotrax</a> and it’s absolutely perfect for kids under six years old.  The exact set we inherited is no longer for sale, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-GeoTrax-Control-Timbertown-Railway/dp/B001W1YG56">Timbertown Railway</a> is pretty close.  Ours is made up of a whole bunch of snap-and-go plastic tracks and includes bridges, a windmill, and even a station that will load packages onto your train.  The engine is battery-operated and makes a pleasant chug-chug noise, while the remote control is big, wireless, and easy for small hands to operate.  It looks good, is super-easy to put together,  and happily chugs around our tree.    We have enough track to try out several configurations and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-GeoTrax-Train-Rail/dp/B000NW2D4Q">expansion packs</a> are just an Amazon one-click away.</p>

<p>Another great thing about the set is that it’s seemingly  indestructible.  It’s been stepped on, kicked, and disassembled (by kids and adults) numerous times and nothing’s ever actually broken.  You can’t even forget to turn it off and run down the batteries because it stops automatically after ten minutes of non-interaction.</p>

<p>Bottom line: We all love it!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/29/scratching-my-nerd-itch/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/29/scratching-my-nerd-itch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started this blog, I chose a platform that would give me a site that looked fine out of the box so I could concentrate on the writing.  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> fit this requirement and even provided several nice features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built-in search</li>
  <li>Organization with tags so visitors could easily find articles by category</li>
  <li>Easy integration with Disqus comments</li>
  <li>Built-in <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Reference-Shelf/Libraries/RSS-Library/What-Is-RSS.shtml">RSS feed</a> for those who want to subscribe</li>
  <li>Automatic announcement of new articles to Facebook</li>
  <li>Easy integration with <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> (for traffic statistics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, a year later, I have more of a vision for what I want to do with the site and I’m ready to tinker a bit. Unfortunately, while there’s some flexibility in how a Tumblr site looks, but they don’t give you any real control. Ever since high school I’ve spent regular chunks of time writing code and bending computers to my will. I’ve done this as a professional software developer, as a research economist, and often just messing around. The last year has been less geeky than usual as I’ve concentrated on teaching and less technical research projects.  It’s time to scratch my nerd itch.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen to switch to a particularly nerdy blog platform (<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>) that requires using command-line tools, but it has the huge benefit of total control. Octopress is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme">Jekyll</a> which is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and I can tweek it as much as I’d like. I’ve always wanted to learn Ruby and reading and modifying other other people’s code is a great way to learn a language.</p>

<p>In addition to Octopress/Jekyll/Ruby, this project gets me up to speed on several other modern nerdy technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install all sorts of open source software including the latest version of Ruby.</li>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> is what version control will look like for years to come–it’s fast, collaborative, distributed, and flexible.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is where all the coolest open source projects live these days.  Any new software I write that I want to share will go here.    </li>
  <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a powerful layer on top of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allows for powerful adaptive layout of HTML pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Octopress is in part an excuse to fiddle with new tech, it also feels very comfortable as articles are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>–a very lightweight text-based markup language that I lately find myself using for almost everything.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s New?</h2>

<p>On the surface, the site shouldn’t look all that different, but beyond the engine being replaced, there are several subtle changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A real <a href="http://highvariance.net/about.html">About</a> page</li>
  <li>Links up top for the main categories I tend to write about</li>
  <li>A search bar near the top of every page</li>
  <li>Quick links to my recent posts and my favorite posts.</li>
  <li>Much better layout for mobile devices</li>
  <li>Super-fast rendering since Octopress generates the whole site as static HTML which just sits on the server</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="was-it-easy-to-migrate-from-tumblr">Was it Easy to Migrate from Tumblr?</h2>

<p>Two things helped a lot: The Octopress documentation is excellent and I already had all the articles on my local machine in Markdown. The only thing that was tricky was backwards compatibility as I wanted all my old URL’s to work and all my discussions to transfer over.  I used the <a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">alias-generator</a> plugin and a little elbow grease to make all my Tumblr URL’s redirect to my new URL’s.   </p>

<p>Disqus (the service that keeps track of comments) says they will crawl your new site and use any redirects it provides to update their database.  Unfortunately, while <em>browsers</em> can understand the redirects that the alias-generator creates<sup id="fnref:fn_ag"><a href="#fn:fn_ag" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> just fine, the <em>disqus crawler</em> does not.  So I had to create a csv file that mapped all the old URL’s to the new ones and upload that.</p>

<p>Announcements of new articles on Facebook are now handled by <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.  It will likely take a little fine-tuning to get these right.</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-the-horizon">What’s on the Horizon?</h2>

<p>The primary emphasis of this site remains the text, but I do want to integrate a little more media–even just a few pictures here and there would be nice. I want the category pages to have their own looks. Beyond that, all I know is that I’ve now got the power to do anything.  Should be fun!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:fn_ag">
      <p>Since the site is static, it can’t actually send HTTP
301 permanent redirects. Instead, the alias-generator creates HTML stub files for all the old URL’s with http-equiv meta tags containing the new locations of the URLs.<a href="#fnref:fn_ag" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/26/neighborhood-caroling/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/26/neighborhood-caroling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our neighborhood is so awesome. For the last three years (at least) on the evening before Halloween nearly all the kids gather for the Pumpkin Parade.  Everyone wears their costumes and brings their carved pumpkins in a wagon or a stroller and we all proceed to march around the block.  Afterward we have hot cider and cookies and catch up with our friends.</p>

<p>This summer a new neighbor hosted the world’s greatest barbecue block party.  There was terrific turnout and highlights included a hammock filled with up to 10 little girls at any given moment, a sunshine piñata, and a giant cannoli.  The party gave birth to an email list which spawned a Facebook group which then led to last week’s first annual neighborhood Christmas caroling.  We are positively swimming in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0743203046">social capital</a>!</p>

<p>About 40 kids and grown ups arrived at Cathy and John’s house at 5:45 for cookies and hot cocoa and some warm up songs. R especially enjoyed belting out The Twelve Days of Christmas as she had been practicing it over dinner all week. Then we all walked and sang along the Pumpkin Parade route and finished with even more cookies and cocoa.</p>

<p>In the interests of making a super-fun event even better next year, I’ve done some thinking and I’ve got some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Plan on singing a lot of songs.  We had a printout of about 7 that didn’t last long enough and folks weren’t ready to repeat them after the first round.  And very few people knew more than the first verse of even the most popular carols.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggest that folks download a caroling app that has lyrics.  I think the best one is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sing-along-to-50+-christmas/id481902746?mt=8">Sing Along to 50+ Christmas Carols</a> but it’s $4.99 which might be more than most folks (not me!) want to spend.  It’s got the music and big fonts and karaoke style moving lyrics.  A cheaper option is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/christmas-carols/id296111618?mt=8">Christmas Carols</a> for 99 cents that has they lyrics for more than 100 songs but no fancy graphics.  The best part about having an app is that it only requires one hand–you don’t need a hand for the lyric printout and another for the flashlight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have someone in front that sets a slow pace.  Our group quickly spread out such that the back couldn’t hear what the front was singing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put up signs so everyone in the neighborhood knows it’s happening.  One of the best parts of the experience was when families would come out on their stoops to listen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick a charity and collect money for it along the way. This might make some people uncomfortable, but I think it would be worth it.  Certainly to the folks who would receive the donations  would appreciate it and this seems like a great opportunity to exercise (not exorcise) the Christmas spirit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Merry Christmas everyone!</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/22/happy-blogoversary/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/22/happy-blogoversary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first time I saw the World Wide Web, I was hunched over an 8 lb laptop using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">text based browser</a> and a 56k modem. There wasn’t much to see and it didn’t seem like a big deal. Then about three month’s later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a> (the first graphical browser) was released and I “got it.” Within a week <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaviSoft">we</a> redefined our product line and turned a generic set of “network publishing” tools into a web server and a web authoring tool.  Within a year we were purchased by America Online to show that they “got” the web too. My point is that I’ve been deeply embedded in the web for a long time.  </p>

<p>And yet, not including my professional <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dm529">web-based resume/cv</a>, I didn’t have my own website until exactly a year ago when High Variance was <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/14573237390/first-post">born</a>. I’m not sure why it took me so long to get here, but after a year of any project, I think it’s important to step back and take stock to see if the original goals are being met. I had three:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create more:</strong>  As expected, the topics have been eclectic ranging from economic policy to kid book reviews to eighties pop music.  The rate of production has been similarly irregular with a burst of activity last January (17 posts) and a summer hiatus.  But the aggregate rate has been about one post per week.  I’m happy with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learn to write better and more comfortably:</strong> Perhaps my biggest surprise is how enjoyable the whole process has been. I don’t get anxious when I write here and my anxiety level when writing professionally has definitely decreased.  When my mind is spinning about a topic, writing about it actually gets me to calm down and figure out what I actually think about it.  As for the quality of the writing, I think I’m getting better, but it’s hard to tell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide entertaining, useful, and/or inspiring content:</strong> My audience will need to be the judge of this, but I know I’ve given at least a few chuckles, a few bits of helpful advice, and even tugged on a few heartstrings.  And in looking back on what I’ve written, much of the content seems to have aged well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose I should also say something about my readership. According to Google Analytics, over the past year I’ve have 2,070 unique visitors (5.7 per day) and 4,000 page views (11 per day). Not much, but if you squint at the chart, it does look like traffic is trending slightly up.  There are even a few posts that get regular search engine traffic–<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18591130112/why-are-zebras-so-mean-and-horses-so-nice">zebras</a>, <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/23166850855/pdf-annotation-on-the-ipad-in-2012">pdf annotation on the iPad</a>, and <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/16047390011/mincer-1958">Mincer 1958</a> are the top three.</p>

<p>As I was about to blow out the candles on my birthday cake a few weeks ago I realized something very special: I didn’t have anything new to wish for.  I have a wonderful wife and two lovely children.  We’re all healthy and happy with our jobs and our house.  I just want what I already have.  That’s kind of true of this blog too.  So here’s to another fun and fulfilling year!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Conflict and Sharing]]></title>
    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/17/conflict-and-sharing/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/17/conflict-and-sharing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about conflict and sharing lately. First because we watch this Sesame Street video almost every night with the girls:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl3e-OUnavQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In case you’re video-averse and don’t want to watch the whole hilarious two minutes and seven seconds, Robin Williams and the two-headed monster “introduce” children to the word <em>conflict</em>. I put “introduce” in quotes because this is a concept with which every child older than 6 months is already intimately familiar. Some kids might use different terms–“fighting!” is quite popular in our house–but the concept is clear. The video also shows the two-headed monster doing something that’s a little less natural for kids: sharing. </p>

<p>Second, my blog-friend<sup id="fnref:fn_blogfriend"><a href="#fn:fn_blogfriend" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Chris Blattman <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2012/12/13/where-property-rights-really-come-from/">wrote</a> recently about how they handle sharing at his daughter’s daycare. In a nutshell, they don’t push it and instead focus on developing a child’s sense of ownership.  The idea is that when kids realize that their stuff won’t be rudely ripped away when friends express interest, they will start sharing voluntarily. </p>

<p>but mostly interact with through their blog. It makes for awkward conversations as you always feel closer to them than they feel to you.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest reason I’ve been thinking about this subject is the conflict and relatively smaller amount of sharing that happens at home with the girls (4 yrs and ~18 months).  We have developed our own fairly complex tri-partite system of communal rights, partial rights, and exclusive rights.  Most of the toys are communal property–there is no “mine” for these. When one kid is playing with a toy in this category and the other kid wants in, we try to get them to say “Can I have a turn?” and then enforce a reasonably short time limit. </p>

<p>A smaller group of toys have owners (e.g., birthday presents) but still must be shared. These often come in groups (like fairies or ponies) where it’s fun to play with the whole group, but neither kid owns the whole group. Dividing ownership in this way provides incentives to play together–if you share your own stuff, you get access to your sibling’s stuff too. This arrangement is also designed to break down R’s hoarding tendencies.</p>

<p>The last category is the smallest: pure property rights.  R has a plush pony and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Toy-Amelia-Groovy-Girl/dp/B0077LGIEM">groovy girl</a> in this group and her sister has a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Monster-Plush-Bowling/dp/B000GL1DTA">6 small plush monsters</a>.  The girls are certainly allowed to share these (R rarely does) but sharing is never required. Occasionally one girl will pick up the other’s toy, but when owner notices and demands it back, it’s always given up immediately.</p>

<p>Our system isn’t perfect and may in fact be more complicated than the girls’ little brains can handle. My bet is that if we reduced the number of categories, we would also reduce the amount of conflict. But I’m not sure what category(ies) would go. I don’t want to assign an owner to every toy–that would be miserable to keep track of and wouldn’t promote a cooperative spirit.  I like that they maintain some ownership of presents that they’ve received individually.  And the most extreme group is where we see the least amount of conflict–the last thing I want is <em>more</em> fighting!  So we’re going to keep the system we’ve got and hope that the kids are learning about both property rights and cooperation.  Check back in twenty years to see if it worked.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/13/playing-the-victim/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/13/playing-the-victim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The eighties are not known as a time of soul bearing honesty (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair">Iran-Contra</a>), but
eighties music is full of cheesy earnestness about love in its various
messy forms.  Eighties singers told the hard truths even when it made
them look weak.  Here are four great examples of eighties guys who
weren’t afraid to play the victim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9abYzI9ycjk">Everything She Wants</a> (by
Wham, 1984): George Michael is having a rough time with a no-good
money-grubbing girlfriend.  I smile every time he finds out
she’s pregnant and says “If my best isn’t good enough, how can it be
good enough for two?  I can’t work any harder than I do!” Maybe this was
the incident that turned him off women forever?  Not that there’s
anything wrong with that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu788foYCa8">I’ve Done Everything For You</a>
(Rick Springfield, 1981): Based on my analysis of his catalog, this
guy seems like he was just a bad boyfriend.  He lusted after his friend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYkbTyHXwbs">Jessie’s girl</a>.  He told his girl not to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp42V938eBA">talk to strangers</a>.  And here
he says “I’ve done everything for you; you’ve done nothing for me!”
At least he was <a href="http://ztams.com/index.php?action=display&amp;ref=26342">good looking</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0">Don’t You Want Me?</a>(by
The Human League, 1981) This is another case of a guy who did
everything–“I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around”
and she’s got the nerve to dump him.  What’s unique in this song is that she
gets the opportunity to tell her side of the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZW1C3neao">The Rain</a> (by Oran Juice
Jones, 1986): Here’s where we see that eighties male victimhood
crossed race lines.  The best part of the song is when we listen in on Mr. Jones
confronting his cheating girlfriend and telling her “You gotta get on
outta here with that alley-cat-coat-wearing, punch-bucket-shoe-wearing
crumbcake I saw you with. Cause you dismissed!”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/08/thoughts-on-moocs/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/12/08/thoughts-on-moocs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc">MOOC</a> is an acroynm for Massive Open Online Course.  It’s a trendy name
for packing up a course’s content (video lectures, problem sets, exams,
a mechanism for peer interactions, etc.) and making it available to a large
number of students over the internet without requiring significant live instructor input.
It’s that last part that allows the system to scale and separates the
idea from simple distance learning or a traditional online course.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about MOOC’s is the expansion in availability of
university-level content.  At least three groups of top-tier
universities in the US (<a href="http://www.edx.org">edX</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.org">Udacity</a>) are
actively producing these kinds of online courses and making them
available for free to anyone.  It means that kids and
adults from rural China to urban Brazil can watch and learn from the
some of the best professors in the world and interact with each other
about the material.</p>

<p>A second exciting thing about MOOC’s is that they promise to be a major
disruptive innovation for existing institutions of higher education.
Think about what happens in an average traditional college course.  The
professor stands up and gives a lecture taking occasional questions from
the class. He/she assigns reading and homework and gives exams. They are
somewhat available to answer questions in office hours or by email. A
MOOC isn’t better on every dimension, but I believe they’ve recently crossed a
line and the overall experience is actually better than the average
college course.  </p>

<p>As students become aware of MOOC’s, I think a few will decide to forego
college and instead learn what they want to learn more cheaply and on
their own schedule.  Most students (and their future employers) however
will want a credential (degree) that “proves” they have mastered a set
of material.  It’s only a matter of time before the big three (or
someone new) comes along and is able to provide this.  Online degrees
exist today and I predict they will become more and more
mainstream.<sup id="fnref:fn_dating"><a href="#fn:fn_dating" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  That said, the current college experience is more than
courses and I think the market for that won’t be going away soon.  </p>

<p>Students will also start demanding more of classes at existing
universities and attending colleges that raise their game and start
providing higher quality in-class experiences.  That means colleges will
have to leverage what they have that the MOOC’s will never have: live
instructors/experts that are able to spend time either one-on-one or in
small groups with students answering questions and having real time
conversations. This is possible online, but it doesn’t scale up to
massive numbers of students per instructor.  Some faculty will start
building on MOOC content–that is, they will replace their own lectures
with those of the MOOC’s and add their own interactivity.  And I’m happy
to say that the he big live lecture will go the way of the horse and
buggy–average professors just won’t be able to compete with the top
professors in the world and their video lectures.</p>

<p>I was going to title this post “The Revolution’s Coming” but the
revolution is already here.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/11/19/raising-the-retirement-age/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/11/19/raising-the-retirement-age</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like Paul Krugman a lot–we’re both liberals and believe strongly in
the value of big government and thougtful regulation.  Unfortunately, he
sometimes has strong opinions about things he hasn’t thought through.
That’s my only explanation for his <a href="">recent article</a> on the “cruelty” of
raising the Social Security retirement age–a policy I think is smart on
almost every dimension.  </p>

<p>The Social Security system was designed after the Great Depression to do
two things: keep old people out of poverty and insure against disability
that prevents people from working to support themselves.  The disability
insurance part of Social Security is less well-known than its retirement
benefits but is very important and I have nothing to say about it today.
You’ll note that I didn’t mention a third objective: funding a long
retirement for most people after they’ve worked a sufficient number of
years.  The Social Security system is expected to provide this now, but
it certainly wasn’t at the beginning.</p>

<p>In 1930, the average white 20 year old male could be expected to live to
age 66 (<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html">source</a>).  If he
made it to age 40, he could expect to live to age 69, and if he made it
to age 50, his expected age of death increased to about 72 years.  During
the bulk of the years he contributed to Social Security, he was
expecting a fairly short (1 to 7 year) period after age 65 when he could
actually retire with full benefits.  Even FDR didn’t see the goal as
funding people’s “golden years”:</p>

<pre><code>"We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against
one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we
have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection
to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job
and against poverty-ridden old age."

-- President Roosevelt upon signing Social Security Act ([source](http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html))
</code></pre>

<p>Contrast this with the experiences of people in 2004 (the latest year I
could easily find data). A 20 year old expected to live to 77 years, a
40 year old to 78 years, and a 50 year old to 79 years.  The expected
duration of retirement ranged from 12 to 14 years.  Krugman is right
that the expected length of retirement upon reaching age 65 has not
changed all <em>that</em> much
(<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/basicfact.htm">from 14 years to almost 20 years</a>),
but that’s irrelevant to people’s expectations during working life.</p>

<p>Other things have changed since the Social Security was enacted too.
While original benefits were high enough to keep retirees out of
poverty, modern levels replace a much larger fraction of income.  Jobs
are a lot less physically demanding today.  In 1940, 26.7% of those
employed worked on farms or did miscellaneous forms of physical labor
relative to just 5.9% in 1990.  And in 1940, only 21.3% of workers were
managers, officials, clerical workers, or professionals.  This ballooned
to more than half the work force by 1990.  (More detailed breakdowns
<a href="http://www.demographicchartbook.com/Chartbook/images/figures/fig16-1.pdf">here</a>).
Finally, I’m pretty sure physical health of those who do survive to 65
is better now than it has been in the past though I couldn’t easily find
data to back that up.</p>

<p>Most people who reach 65<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are strongly enouraged by the incentives in
the Social Security system to retire even though they are perfectly
capable of being highly productive members of the work force.  I believe
their experience is a huge untapped resource for the economy.  But what
of the people that Krugman is worried about: Those who worked physically
stressful jobs for years and at age 65 don’t expect to live all that
much longer.  I have a heart and I worry about this group too.  Suppose
we let people retire at age 65 but capped their benefits at a relatively
low level.  This constraint would be unbinding for those who worked low
paying (and more likely physically demanding) jobs.  At the same time,
it would encourage relatively wealthier (and healthier) folks to work
until they were, say, 70 years old.  If wealthier people really want to
retire earlier, they can save more during their working lives and rely
on Social Security for what it was designed: insurance against poverty
in old age.  We all win!</p>

<p>benefits at 62 and higher benefits if they wait until the “full
retirement age” of 65.  The amounts are designed to make the people
fairly indifferent between the two dates.  In the next few years, the
full retirement age will be going up to age 67 (details
<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/agereduction.htm">here</a>).</p>

    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/11/16/kid-book-review-halloween</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a week before Halloween, R and I raided the library’s selection of
Halloween-appropriate picture books.  I’ve felt
<a href="http://highvariance.net/post/21370720836/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-2">guilty before</a>
about skimming the cream but hopefully sharing what we learned
will balance out the karma.  Before I start, I know what you’re
thinking: “It’s the middle of November!  Who cares about Halloween?  How about sharing something useful
like the top 10 Thanksgiving picture books?”  Don’t worry, that’ll be
here before Christmas.  In the meantime, bookmark this page and put a
note on your calendar to check back on October 15, 2013 and then head to
your local library.  On with the show!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklins-Halloween-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590693301">Franklin’s Halloween</a>
(by Paulette Bourgeois, illustrated by Brenda Clark) Franklin is one
of my favorite recurring lovable-yet-flawed characters.  He’s just a
regular kid (turtle) who usually gets in some sort of minor trouble
and learns from his mistakes.  He’s kind of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Messy-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590486861">messy</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Plays-Game-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590226312">not very athletic</a>,
and has even been known to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franklin-Fibs-Paulette-Bourgeois/dp/0590446479">tell a fib or two</a>.  In this book, he just
has fun making his own Halloween costume and going to a party.
There’s a great spooky twist at the end and he’s even generous to a
sick friend.  Hurray for Franklin!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brooms-Are-Flying-Michael-Rex/dp/0312380151">Brooms Are for Flying</a> (by Michael Rex) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humbug-Witch-Lorna-Balian/dp/159572009X">Humbug Witch</a> (by
Lorna Bailin) Spoiler Alert!  These two books are simple and cute.
One is about a witch who turns out to be a girl at the end and the
other is about a girl who turns out to be a witch at the end!  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WITCH-WHO-LIVES-DOWN-HALL/dp/B000J4MU7I">The Witch Who Lives Down the Hall</a> (by Donna Guthrie, illustrated
by Amy Schwartz) The mostly black and white illustrations (with
touches of orange) are a great complement to a story about a boy who
lives down the hall from a “strange” lady and her black cat.  He’s
convinced she’s a witch.  Clever and funny to both kids and adults.
Reminded me a lot of <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/18359444436/kid-book-review-monster-edition">Mrs. Muffly’s Monster</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Halloween-Night-James-Stevenson/dp/0688099327">That Terrible Halloween Night</a>
  (by James Stevenson) This is about as scary as you can get and still
  be appropriate for a three year-old. I loved it and R is still talking
  about it.  Last night she told me our basement floor was covered with
  frogs!  I liked the pen and pastel comic book layout too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cake-Girl-David-Lucas/dp/B003NHR9OM">Cake Girl</a> (by David Lucas) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Lucas/e/B001HMTVBY">David Lucas</a> is so good–all his books
have such sweet characters, surreal stories, and pretty
illustrations.  This one is about a witch who learns about friendship.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/30/bathroom-fan-love-letters/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/30/bathroom-fan-love-letters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two of my favorite bloggers (<a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="http://brooksreview.net">Ben Brooks</a>) recently
published passionate <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/05/06/bathroom-fan-timer-switches">love</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/amazon-item/">letters</a> to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TJAGPS">Panasonic WhisperCeiling</a> bathroom
fan, and in Marco’s case, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00313JXB0">Leviton electronic timer switch</a>.  Since
our downstairs bathroom has had no fan at all for more than a year, and
our upstairs bathroom fan sounded like a jet engine (and took 20 minutes
to de-fog a mirror), I took this as a sign that it was time to upgrade.
It was harder than expected to find an electrician to install them, but
today was the big day.  It’s worked out pretty well for our upstairs
bathroom, but not so much for the downstairs bathroom.  In fact, I was
surprised by three issues that were unmentioned in the “reviews” I read:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Panasonic WhisperLite fan/light combo unit is approximately
square and it doesn’t fit in our downstairs bathroom because we have a
cast-iron drain pipe running 8.5” away from the stud where the fan has
to be mounted.  Drat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulbs in the WhisperLite are compact-fluorescent and they send
out a very white light.  I like it, but my wife calls it “institutional”
and she says it reminds her of a public restroom.  This isn’t exactly
where anyone wants to be taking a shower, and if she doesn’t acclimate, I’m
hoping we can just change the bulbs to something a little softer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leviton switch requires three wires (including a neutral) and our
downstairs bathroom only has two.  If I want a timer switch we either
spend $200 to run a new line (I’m not <em>that</em> crazy) or we get one of
those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intermatic-FD15MWC-15-Minute-Spring-Loaded/dp/B000EVS4WG">spring-loaded knobs</a> that screams hotel sauna.  For now, we’re
sticking with the old manual switch.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To be fair, the new fan is very quiet and is working like a champ–our
upstairs bathroom isn’t small and during a leisurely shower the mirror
never fogged up.  And the Leviton timer is far more reliable than I was
about remembering to turn off the fan when it’s done its job.  But I
think there is a bigger lesson here: Some products that are perfect for
some people (or bathrooms) are not perfect for others, and we shouldn’t
let ourselves be blinded by the opinions of fan-bois.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/25/apple-observations/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/25/apple-observations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s big October product announcements are now behind us and I’ve
read more blogger reactions than I care to admit.  Even I’m surprised
that I still have a few somewhat original thoughts of my own to share.
Instead of simply being an “iPad mini” event Apple announced a whole
slew of products.  While some folks predicted some of the “extra”
stuff, I don’t think anyone expected the sheer quantity we saw.  That
said, I’m most excited about two products Apple did not announce:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A new Thunderbolt display:</strong> The new iMac is beautiful and I can’t
wait until they translate it into a stand-alone display.  Less glare and
pixels closer to the glass will be terrific.  It will also give Apple a
chance to add a few ports that they neglected on the first rev: USB 3
and analog audio out.  And imagine how thin it will be when it doesn’t
have to also house a whole computer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Fusion Drive:</strong> I know, I know, they DID announce this as an
option for the new iMac and Mac Mini, but I’m hoping they will sell it
separately so I can stick one in my 2010 iMac.  I really like the idea
of having the speed of an SSD and the size of a traditional HD without
the hassle of managing the pair.  We’ll have to wait for the iFixit
teardown to see if it has a new interface (and is thus incompatible) and
something tells me even if it has standard wiring, Apple will want to
reserve this feature as reason for folks to upgrade their old (but
perfectly usable) iMacs.  I can still dream.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s been a lot of talk about how Apple is making a mistake by
pricing the iPad mini at $329 and leaving breathing room for the other
cheaper small tablets in the market.  I think Apple priced the product
as high as possible such that they will sell all the mini’s they can make
before the holidays.  If they didn’t, they would simply be leaving money
on the table.  When their supply chain gets up to speed some time in the
spring, I predict they will drop the price below $300.</p>

<p>I have very mixed feelings about the new iMac.  While it’s gorgeous and
powerful, I’m not sure I agree with the sacrifices Apple had to make to
achieve its super-model-thin curves.  Most iMac owners spend
the bulk of their time in <em>front</em> of their iMac where they never even
see the curves–my own is right up against a wall, and I’d have to lean
over and around my desk to appreciate the sides and back.</p>

<p>Apple loves to be first to cast old standards aside: Remember when the
iMac dropped the floppy drive?  I think they were the first PC maker to
stop using special keyboard and mouse ports and just rely on USB.  And
just a month ago they said goodbye to the venerable Dock Connector.  Now
they want to do the same thing to the optical drive.  For a notebook,
this makes perfect sense: In the last year there was exactly one time
when it would have been nice to mount a CD on my Air and that is
certainly not enough to justify the added weight and bulk of a drive.
At my desk, I do rip the occasional DVD or used CD.  And I’m certainly
not throwing my iMac in my bag when I head out on the town.  But maybe
Apple’s right.  Maybe folks should just keep an ugly old SuperDrive in a
drawer for those rare occasions when they need it.  Then they can
appreciate beautiful design every day.  Even if it means leaning over
their desks to do so.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As you may remember from <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/22767550387/carle-vs-lionni-no-accounting-for-taste">my last post</a>, my older daughter loves Greek
mythology, but the stories are hopelessly age-inappropriate. We’ve been
reading them anyway and I try to tone them down on the fly with limited
success.  What I’ve really wanted was something that could extract the
magic and wonder of the creatures and leave the ultra-violence and the
mixed moral messages behind.  It turns out I owe Eric Carle an apology
because he’s published exactly the book I was looking for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eric-Carles-Dragons-Carle/dp/014240103X">Dragons, Dragons</a> combines Eric Carle’s admittedly pretty
collage pictures with poems about 30 mythical creatures from around the
world.  Many are from Greek myths (e.g., Cerberus, Pegasus, the
Minotaur!) but they also hail from Japan (kappa), Africa (Okolo), the
Americas (Quetzalcoatl), Australia (bunyip), the Middle East
(manticore and roc), and other places.  In some cases the artistic representations don’t
match the images in my head (in addition to his lion’s head, the
chimaera has a goat’s head sprouting out of his back!) but considering
we don’t have any actual specimens to determine who is “correct,” I
don’t mind.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the book is the poetry.  Why should mythical
creatures be constrained to prose?  To accompany his illustrations,
Mr. Carle has chosen work ranging from classic (William Blake and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning) to poets I’ve never heard of but are a lot
of fun (see Laura Whipple’s contribution above).  R learns vocabulary
when we read them and she definitely appreciates the vivid word pictures
and rhymes.  She’s already memorized a few of the poems and there’s even
one (the Phoenix) that is written specifically for two voices.</p>

<p><a href="http://highvariance.net/post/22767550387/carle-vs-lionni-no-accounting-for-taste">I’m still not a fan</a> of all of Eric Carle’s work, but this book is almost perfect.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/06/violence-in-kids-books/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/06/violence-in-kids-books</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My 3.5 year old daughter wants to be a minotaur for Halloween. She loves
the idea of a person with a bull’s head. She knows that minotaurs live
in labyrinths and eat humans.  For her costume, she wants to carry an
axe.  And whenever we play minotaur, she wants me to be Theseus and she
often wants to “fight to death!”  Someday she’ll know what death is and
understand the consequences of a real fight, but for now these are just
fun words to say.</p>

<p>It all started more than a year ago when she was in a phase where she
wanted me to tell her new stories all the time.  And I mean about 25
times per day.  I quickly ran out of kid stories and moved on to stories
about my old pets and stories about my childhood.  Then I remembered the
Greeks had some good stories and started telling her about Daedalus and
Icarus, Pandora’s Box, and the 12 Labors of Heracles.  She thought they
were great and I ordered a copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greek-Myths-Young-Children-Heather/dp/0794530494">Greek Myths for Young Children</a> which was age inappropriate
(despite the title) but at least jogged my memory for a few more
stories.</p>

<p>About a month ago I brought out the book again and she loved it so much
she asked for a new Greek myth as her bed-time story every night.  She
especially loved the vivid characters and creatures, and she can now
tell you that Prince Bellerophon rode Pegasus, Cerberus has three heads,
and a Chimaera has the body of a goat, head of a lion and a snake for a
tail.  The stories were violent, but the language was relatively tame.</p>

<p>I was ambivalent about the situation, but then we crossed a line when I
picked up a few more “kids” mythology books at the library.  Suddenly
instead of just eating humans, the minotaur “had a taste for human
flesh.”  Centaurs were getting drunk and chasing bridesmaids and the
sphinx was tearing apart unfortunate travelers and devouring them.  I
skipped a lot of this, but then the babysitter started reading the
stories verbatim.  It was bad.</p>

<p>Now some people might wonder what the big deal is.  Weren’t old fairy
tales really violent too?  Didn’t Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother
get eaten by a wolf?  Didn’t Hansel and Gretel get cooked in an oven?
Indeed, they did.  And those fairy tales werre written at a time when
violence was a normal part of everyday life.  Public life in the middle
class United Stated is far far less violent today and we run a pretty
pacifist household.  Violent fairy tales are not “keeping it real” for
us. I feel no need to expose my girls to realistic stories of violence
until they’ve got the tools to understand and process it.  I don’t want
to violence to be normal.  I don’t want them scared that if they go in
the woods they will get eaten by a witch or a wolf.  I don’t want them
playing fighting games at school even if they seem fun or even funny.</p>

<p>The time will come when all the violence that exists in pop culture on
tv, in the theater, at the movies, and in grown-up books will push
through our walls and into their lives.  And hopefully by that time they
will be old enough to know that it’s serious business.</p>

<p>Does this mean we’re banning Greek myths from house?  Not exactly.
We’re trying a compromise solution.  For now, I edit as I read. Theseus
and the Minotaur fight, but not always to the death.  Heracles has a
simpler young adulthood where he does not “fly into a rage and kill all
his children.”  And Theseus’ father doesn’t leap off a cliff to his
death because his son forgot to fly the white sail.  When the girls are
older they can read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bulfinchs-Mythology-Volumes-Chivalry-Charlemagne/dp/1440426309">Bullfinch’s</a> on their own and get maximum
mayhem. Until then Theseus and the Minotaur can be friends who
occasionally walk Cerberus around the block.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/02/iphone5-ios6-review/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/10/02/iphone5-ios6-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I got my iPhone 5 about a week ago (pre-ordered from AT&amp;T) and have
barely been able to brag about it to anyone since most of my local
friends aren’t nearly as nerdy as I am.  Then I remembered that I had a
blog and decided the world needed hear all about my new device.</p>

<p>But first, a little background: Two years ago I started carrying an
iPhone 4 and a year ago I was only slightly tempted to upgrade to a 4S.
The camera was a little better, the cpu was a little faster, and it had
Siri which I didn’t think I’d use much.  And I would have had to pay the
one year upgrade penalty.  I passed.  Fast-forward to this year and I
was champing at the bit for something new.  </p>

<p>And so, without further ado, here’s what I’d say if you saw me on the
street and said “Ooh, is that an iPhone 5?  How do you like it?”</p>

<h2 id="big-stuff">Big Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>Camera:</strong> It’s way better.  Low light pictures look a lot better, but
 the thing I really notice is the speed.  It launches quickly (the 4 was
 a dog), and you can tap away at the shutter seemingly several times a
 second.  It’s a life-saver when you have an older daughter who loves
 funny faces and chewing on her own hair, but occasionally flashes the
 most beautiful smile you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p><strong>Maps:</strong> I get it that if you live in a place where the coverage stinks,
 the new Maps app stinks too.  But in New Haven, the coverage is fine.
 And it’s huge upgrade over IOS 5 both in terms of features and UI.
 Turn-by-turn voice directions are extremely well integrated–much nicer
 and more functional than either Tom Tom or Navigon.  I love that you
 can flip back and forth between the 2D map of your route and the 3D
 rendering of where you are on the route.  The vector-based tiles are
 prettier and faster to download too.  I’m glad I have the Tom Tom app,
which stores maps locally, for when I’m out of cell range, but let’s
 be honest: that hasn’t happened in years and it will be a while before
 it happens again.</p>

<p><strong>CPU:</strong> It’s way faster.  I have a shortcut on my home screen that launches
OmniFocus and goes straight to “new task” screen.  It used to take about
5 seconds, but now it’s less than a second.  All sorts of other stuff
loads and runs faster too.</p>

<p><strong>64 GB flash:</strong> In this cloud-based age we live in, local storage isn’t
 supposed to matter since your apps should just be able to pull in what
 you need from the net as you need it.  But as I’ve complained bitterly
 about <a href="http://highvariance.net/post/19041134391/photos-iphoto-ios-icloud-im-underwhelmed">already</a>, Apple’s vision of cloud photography is currently
 Photo Stream.  Ugh.  With double the room on my device, both my wife
 and I can stop carefully deciding what pictures and home videos we have
 space for.  Some day <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/revel.html">Adobe Revel</a> might solve this more elegantly,
 but for now they don’t do video and they don’t have a Windows app.</p>

<h2 id="little-stuff">Little Stuff:</h2>

<p><strong>The physical device:</strong> Yeah, it’s nice.  But my eyes aren’t good enough to
really appreciate the straight lines and shiny camfer.  And it’s really
thin, especially since I’m going caseless for now compared to my old
rubber-clad 4.  It feels great in the pocket but it’s surprisingly hard
to pick up off a counter or desk!  My wife thinks it feels a little like
a Nano, and she’s right.</p>

<p><strong>Screen:</strong> I can’t tell if the colors are more saturated or if the pixels
are closer to the surface but supposedly they are.  It’s nice to have
more text on the screen in portrait mode, but this is partially offset
by the awkwardness of moving my thumb to the opposite top corner.  This
has become easier with time, so I’m guessing I’ll completely
adjust soon.  The extra row of icons is useful as my home screen was
getting a little cramped.  I rarely venture to my other screens now, and
that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Lightning:</strong> I like it a lot–it’s durable, tiny, and easy since it’s
double-sided.  It’s a little annoying that I now need different cables
for my phone and iPad, but Apple had to upgrade this connector
eventually and I think we’ll have Lightning for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>LTE:</strong> in some ways, this is the biggest new feature of the phone. When
you’re near an LTE tower, it’s crazy fast–the other day SpeedTest gave
me 28Mbps downstream and 12 Mbps upstream.  That’s 3x and 8x faster than
my U-Verse at home!  Of course, per byte, it’s expensive and I’m on wifi
90% of the time.  And right now, AT&amp;T’s coverage isn’t that great.</p>

<p><strong>Siri:</strong> We’re still just getting to know each other, but I like what I
 hear so far.  It’s absolutely the fastest way to enter new appointments
 on my calendar.  Last Friday I asked “What was the score in last
 night’s NFL game?” and got the box score in moments.  I use it to set
 alarms.  I expected to enjoy the novelty of it and then forget about
 it, but instead my usage seems to be increasing.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts:</h2>

<p>This phone did not need a whole bunch of fancy new features (e.g.,
curved AMOLED display, NFC, giant screen) to be fantastic.  The iPhone
has been fantastic since they introduced it in 2007.  I find it amazing
that they’ve been able to make it incrementally better every year by
refining and improving what it already does.  And yet the tech press
keeps wanting the next iPhone to be a quantum leap.  That’s not how
how it works.  Truly revolutionary devices aren’t 5.0’s, they are
1.0’s.</p>

    <updated>2012-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/06/03/unoriginal-ideas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of myself as a reasonably creative guy.  I’m not always coming
up with particularly useful or imporant ideas, but I like to think
they’re fairly unique.  Unique in a small town or among your friends is
one thing, but unique on the Internet is quite another.  I thought it
would be fun to share some ideas I had for posts that turned out be less
original than I first thought.</p>

<h2 id="is-height-normal">Is height normal?</h2>

<p>Adult height is one of the prototypical examples of a naturally
occurring normal distribution, but if you look at real data, it’s not
perfectly normal.  First off, it’s a mixture of men and women who
individually have pretty normal heights but quite different means (by
about 5”).  Second, the tails of the distribution are fatter than
normal.  That is, extremely short and tall people are far more common
than predicted by a pure normal distribution.  All this is explained
very nicely explained in two 2008 posts (<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-normally-distributed/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/11/25/distribution-of-adult-heights/">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/20/why-heights-are-not-normally-distributed/">here</a>) by John D. Cook at <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/">The Endeavor</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nietzsche-and-pop-music">Nietzsche and pop music</h2>

<p>There aren’t very many 19th or 20th Century philosophers that inspire
pop songs. The Cure turned Albert Camus’ The Stranger into “Staring at
the Sea”, but up until a few weeks ago I thought that was it.  How wrong I
was!  Kelly Clarkson’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I">What Doesn’t Kill You</a>” has been getting
tremendous airplay on pop stations and it’s not much different from
Christina Aguilera’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOJpIwF47Y">Fighter</a>” which also talks about how being
beaten down just makes her “stronger”, “harder”, and “wiser”.  And it
turns out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujhZoAg2-I">tons and tons of songs</a> have been inspired by this
<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/f/friedrichn159167.html">Nietzsche quote</a>.  I thought it would be fun to see how many more of
Nietzsche’s ideas (e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#.C3.9Cbermensch">Superman</a>)  have been translated into pop
music (maybe “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan#Sunshine_Superman">Sunshine Superman</a>”?).  Turns out Craig
Schuftan has written a <a href="http://startnarrativehere.com/2010/01/hey-nietzsche-leave-them-kids-alone-the-romantic-movement-rock-roll-and-the-end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-by-craig-schuftan-2009">whole book</a> about this called
<em>Hey! Nietzsche! Leave Them Kids Alone!: The Romantic Movement, Rock &amp;
Roll, and the End of Civilisation as We Know It</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-impact-of-cleaning-the-augean-stables">The environmental impact of cleaning the Augean stables</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">The Fifth Labor of Heracles</a> was to clean the Augean stables.
They were so dirty and filthy that he had to divert two rivers through
them to wash out the manure that 1000 cattle had produced over thirty
years.  This reminded me of what happened when hurricanes hit North
Carolina a few years ago and pushed massive amounts of pig waste into
the water supply.  Wouldn’t it be interesting to write a quick
environmental impact statement for Hercules’ act?  A few people have
noticed that the effects were probably pretty serious (<a href="http://thepunnery.wordpress.com/tag/augean-stables/">The Punnery</a>,
<a href="http://hazwastemanagement.info/HazWasteManagement_Solutions/Chapter_16_HWM_2nd_ed_Solutions.pdf">this homework assignment</a> for a class on Hazardous Waste Management)
but no one has actually done any calculations to show how serious.
Hmm….maybe I can contribute something here!</p>

<h2 id="a-sitcom-about-a-woman-with-cancer">A sitcom about a woman with cancer.</h2>

<p>Last month I had a strange dream about developing a sitcom that starred
a woman who is diagnosed with cancer and goes through the whole
treatment process.  The story would have a full three year arc with
cliff-hangers every year when she (or her new best friend who also has
cancer) goes in for testing.  The final episode would be her saying
goodbye.  The show would have lots of funny kids, hair loss jokes, and
nausea jokes.  She could also start a romantic relationship in the
middle of the run.  An awfully large number of people have either had
cancer by now or had someone very close go through it.  I really believe
that a show like this would have a big audience of people who want to
laugh about a serious thing.  Showtime also believed this and started
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_C_(TV_series)">The Big C</a>” in 2010 and it’s entering its third season now.
According to Wikipedia, it’s been very successful since the beginning!</p>

    <updated>2012-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/27/gtd-with-rtm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year or so I get cranky about my task management system and switch
to something new.  This year it’s particularly bad because I’ve been
hearing the Siren Song of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.  I swear every nerd blogger I read
uses it: e.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/08/omnifocus-v-things-mac-ipad-iphone/">The Brooks Review</a></li>
  <li>David Sparks at <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2010/7/30/ipad-omnifocus-review.html">MacSparky</a></li>
  <li>Aleh Cherp at <a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2012/04/02/task-management-with-omnifocus-collecting-and-processing/">Macademic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I even believe John Gruber (<a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>) uses it though he’s a
little cagy since they are often a sponsor of his.</p>

<p>BUT, I strongly believe you shouldn’t switch systems unless you’re
solving specific problems.  That is, I invest in my systems and don’t
want to switch just for fun.  Hearing that some other piece of software
is “really good” or even “better” than what you’re currently using
isn’t good enough for me.</p>

<p>Last year when I made the switch from <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/">Google Tasks</a> to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>
(RTM), I had some clear requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cross-platform</em>: I was spending time on Mac, Windows, iPad, and
 iPhone and I needed to be able to access my tasks from all of them.</li>
  <li><em>Rock solid invisible sync</em>: I never wanted to think about which
 version of my task list I was working with.  There should be just one
 master copy (preferably in the cloud) that gets seemlessly accessed
 and updated from various clients.</li>
  <li><em>Power and flexibility</em>: Google Tasks met the first two criteria, but it was just too
 simple.  I wanted more than due dates and separate lists.  I wanted
 to be able to attach priorities, contexts, durations, and other
 arbitrary tags.  I wanted to  dynamically create lists based on
 these characteristics that showed me just what I wanted (and was
 able) to do at any particular moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time, RTM was the best solution, but the world has changed since
then.  Omnifocus now provides highly regarded Sync Services.  And I’ve
shed my need for Windows now that I carry a MacBook Air with me
everywhere i go.</p>

<p>Stepping up a level for a moment, the overall task management system you
use is far more important than the particular tool you use to implement
it.  I’m a GTD (Getting Things Done) guy, though I’m not the most
orthodox devotee you’ll meet.  There are two things I love about GTD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You get the mental to do list out of your head.  Since you’re not
constantly worrying that you’ll forget something, your mind is freed up
for more interesting creative work.  And you’re not forgetting things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once your tasks are organized, GTD provides a way to quickly see what
you can and should be doing in any given context.  This is exactly what
I couldn’t do with Google Tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After a year of experience (and tweeking), I’ve got an implementation of
my GTD system in Remember The Milk that works pretty well.  Before
casting it aside for a new pretty young thing, I’m going to describe my
system and what works and doesn’t work for me.  It’s almost certainly
not a perfect match for anyone else, but it might give you ideas for
things to try or think about.  </p>

<p>RTM is a simple system that lets you build complex systems on top of it.
Basically, you just define a bunch of lists of tasks with
characteristics.  These characteristics include priorities, due dates,
durations, locations, and arbitrary tags–exactly what I want.  The
power comes from defining Smart Lists that are basically saved searches
based on these characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Even though RTM supports multiple lists, I keep almost all my tasks in
the Inbox list and use other lists only for storing things like books
I’d like to read or ideas for upcoming posts.  I define my projects with
tags.  Home-related projects have tags starting with “ph-“ (e.g.,
“ph-basement”) and work-related projects have tags starting with “pw-“.
Most tasks that go into the system have either a project assigned or a simple
“work” tag.  If it’s a single task home project, I don’t take the time
to assign a project tag at all.</p>

<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<p>I assign each task a single location tag: at-desk, at-phone, at-home,
at-econoffice, at-errand, or at-wife.  The last one is special: tasks
that require consultation with my wife.  Someone else that runs a lot of
errands might find it worth their time to set up several locations that
cause tasks to pop up when they go somewhere, but generally I go
somewhere <em>because</em> I need to do something and so don’t need to get
reminded.</p>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p>Coming up with the right set of contexts is critical to the system and
it’s the hardest part. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">The GTD Book</a>, David Allen talks a lot about home,
office, and phone. With smart phones, the set of things you can do “on
the phone” is far larger than it used to be.  Since I usually have my
laptop with me and most of my resources are online, home office,
work office, and even cafe are almost the same.</p>

<p>Right now I have four smart lists that define my contexts:</p>

<p><strong>c-working</strong> </p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (list:Inbox and (tagContains:pw- or
tag:work or tag:weekday) and (dueWithin:"5 days of today" or
priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the context I look at during the work day or at night when
I’m working.  It includes everything due today or that’s overdue so I
don’t miss deadlines.  It also includes any tasks associated with
work-related projects or that can only be done during the week
(<tt>tag:weekday</tt>).  The most interesting piece is where I drop all
tasks that are due more than five days from now that have no priority
assigned.  These are the tasks I don’t even want to think about until it
gets closer to their due date.</p>

<p><strong>c-weekend</strong></p>

<pre><code>due:today or dueBefore:today or (not tag:work and not
tagContains:pw- and not tag:weekday and list:Inbox and (dueWithin:"5
days of today" or priority:1 or priority:2 or priority:3))&lt;/tt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On weekends and any time I want to focus on the non-work part of my
life I check this list.  It’s almost the inverse of my work context
except that it also includes anything that’s due or past due.</p>

<p><strong>c-out</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:at-errand or tag:at-phone
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I should and can do when I’m out and about.</p>

<p><strong>c-easy</strong></p>

<pre><code>tag:fun or tag:easy or timeEstimate:"&lt; 1 hour"
</code></pre>

<p>When I’m tired or just have a few minutes, I look at this list.  It’s my
newest context, and I might eventually break it into a tired list and a
separate quick-task list.  </p>

<p>All four of these Smart Lists are sorted first by due date and then by
priority.  I often use <strong>high priority</strong> to mark that a task is the
next action for a project.  This way it’s always listed before other
actions that I want to record but might not be ready to do.  A while
back I read <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">another article</a> about implementing GTD in RTM and it
suggested using an <strong>na</strong> tag.  My system allows me to complete a task
for a project and have the other tasks still show up on the list.  The
last thing I want to do is to constantly be tagging new tasks as <strong>na</strong>
as I complete other tasks.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when I want to focus on a particular project
and in those cases I simply look at the Tag view for the project and
see all the tasks associated with the project no matter when they are
due or what their priority.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly Review:</h2>

<p>Just as David Allen says, I’ve found that if I don’t do a weekly review,
the information in the system drifts away from the information in my
brain and loses its value.  That’s when most folks fall off the wagon.
So support for the weekly review process is super-important.  Here’s
what I do every week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at my untagged Smart List (<tt>not isTagged:true list:Inbox</tt>)
and assign project (if necessary) or location tags</li>
  <li>Look at the tasks for each project:
    <ul>
      <li>Are any upcoming tasks missing?  </li>
      <li>Are priorities and due dates right?</li>
      <li>Can I delete any tasks that are no longer needed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any new projects that didn’t make it into the system during the week</li>
  <li>Quickly look at all the tasks in the system (usually between 100 and 150)
    <ul>
      <li>Do I need to lower / raise any priorities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look at what I accomplished in last week (<tt>completedWithin:”1 week
of today”</tt>)–good for setting feasible future expectations </li>
</ul>

<p>One nice thing about this way of doing weekly reviews is that it can be
done in chunks here and there –I don’t have to set aside the
traditional 2-3 hour block.</p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>

<p>On the whole, I’m pretty happy with my system, but that doesn’t mean
there’s not lots of room for improvement.  </p>

<p>First, my system isn’t that great for capturing or doing long range
planning.  I can’t specify task dependencies and I can’t even specify
start dates for tasks.  If I could, that would let me filter out tasks
that I know I’m not starting for a while.  I try to follow orthodox GTD
practice and only use due dates for when things are really due. That way
I don’t miss these things in a sea of stuff that I’d like to be done on
that day.</p>

<p>Second, while the iOS apps are very good, I’m getting tired of the
clunky RTM web interface.  It’s functional, but pretty ugly.   I use
Fluid to make RTM a pop down menubar app, but I can’t get it to play
well with multiple Spaces.  That is, when I pop down the app, it pulls
me back to the Space I first started it.  And when RTM automatically
logs me out of the website (more often than I’d like), 
<a href="http://support.agilebits.com/discussions/1password-38-for-mac-from-agilebits-website/11718-1password-with-fluid">I can’t use 1Password to log back bin</a>.  I’m still totally dumbfounded that
no one has built a decent native Mac app for the service.</p>

<p>Third, entering new tasks requires me to click on the menubar app and
then put the cursor in the new task text entry box.  It sure would be
nice to have a global hot key for this.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Remember The Milk bugs me, but it also works for me.  And maybe
Omnifocus wouldn’t be uniformly better.  I’m worried that it would
try to force me into new ways of doing things that just don’t match my
work flow.  Maybe instead I need to check out <a href="http://donaldjenkins.com/2012/02/why-i-switched-from-omnifocus-to-things/">Things</a>….  Or maybe I
just need to get back to work!</p>

    <updated>2012-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/20/country</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There have been times in my life when I’ve listened to whatever music I
wanted whenever I wanted, but these days, I have a lot more constraints.
At work, I’m pretty underslept and need all the concentration I can
get—that means a silent work environment.  At home, I don’t feel right
cranking up Swedish death metal or even <a href="http://www.directlyrics.com/katy-perry-last-friday-night-lyrics.html">Katy Perry</a> in front of the
kids.  I get my classic rock fix while shopping in the supermarket late
at night, and in the car, all the trashy dance music stations I like are
full of static.</p>

<p>So I’ve started listening to <a href="http://licountry.com/">97.1, My Country</a>.
It comes in crystal clear and plays terrific new country.  Trust me that
I’m as surprised as you are as I’ve always been an “I don’t like
country” guy.  The twang and the stories and the guitar always bugged
me.  I’m not totally sure what’s changed, but over the last few weeks
I’ve Shazamed several songs that I’ve had to buy on iTunes.  Here are my
current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8peBUdlUNmM&amp;ob=av2e">“Country Must Be Country Wide”</a>
(by Brantley Gilbert): This is a straight-up country anthems and it’s so
rockin I swear Bon Jovi could have recorded
it in the mid 80’s.  It’s got awesome guitar and great lines like
“In every state there’s a station playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and
Waylon”.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuaCDPR0ao">“Got My Country On”</a> (by
Chris Cable): Another anthem, this reminds me of all those
rap songs that brag about being the biggest gangsta around.  Except this
gangsta is “Gonna do some chillin, chicken grillin and guitars”.  He
even says he’s “Trickin [his] truck like a Cadillac”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKFb-4t_vg&amp;ob=av2e">“This”</a> (by Darius Rucker): This song couldn’t be more earnest: “Thank
God for all I missed Cause it led me here to this.”  I’ve never been a
Hootie and the Blowfish fan, but maybe I need to give them a chance.  Yikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UCGzawJ1yg">“Drink On It”</a> (by Blake Shelton): This one is less sweet, but just as
earnest.  It’s about a country boy trying to get a girl drunk so he can
sleep with her.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this will country thing be a fad for me.  Or maybe I’ll be wearing Wranglers and
cowboy boots by this time next year.  I’ll definitely pass on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/smokeless">Skoal</a> though.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/16/pdf-annotation-on-the-ipad-in-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always wanted to live life efficiently.  When I was in third grade
I made a list of all the chores I had to do every morning (like make the
bed) and timed myself doing them. I even made my mom assign quality
grades to each task to make sure I wasn’t sacrificing on that margin for
speed.</p>

<p>I don’t make my bed anymore, but I do grade a lot of papers and I like
to give copious feedback. The returns to optimizing this process are
big. That’s why I recently decided to try out several iPad PDF
annotation apps to find the one that best fits my workflow.</p>

<p>My needs aren’t extreme. I mostly want to highlight, strike-through, and
add colored text. Occasionally I want to underline, add a long note, or
draw a shape. And since all my documents live on Dropbox, I want to
easily sync whole folders. It turns out there are at least three apps
that can do all of these things, but they have some important
differences in how they get there.  Here’s what I’ve found:</p>

<h2 id="goodreader-314"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">GoodReader 3.14</a></h2>

<p>GoodReader has been my go-to annotation app for the last six months, and
it sets the bar high.  The only real annoyance is that you have to enter
inline comments (i.e., use the typewriter tool) in a popup editing
window before the app drops your words into the document.  Once
there, it’s easy to grab the comment (by holding a finger on it) and
move or resize the text box.  This is critical since you never know
exactly where or how big the text box will be.  You don’t have any
control over the font for these inline comments and the one it chooses
is cheesy typewriter, but I don’t mind.</p>

<p>Syncing folders with Dropbox is great although the sync button can get
hidden way down in in the “Web Downloads” area are under a long list of
“recent” downloads.  In fact, the whole document management interface is
functional, but messy and unintuitive–i.e., once you know your way
around, you don’t waste a lot of time, but it’s never pretty and there
is a learning curve.</p>

<p>One useful feature I haven’t found in the other apps is a Back button
under the scroll bar that (obviously) puts you back where you were after
you scroll somewhere else or move to a bookmark.  This is great when
you’re flipping between text and tables.</p>

<h2 id="iannotate-pdf-21"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953">iAnnotate PDF 2.1</a></h2>

<p>iAnnotate PDF has a clunky name and a cartoony interface.  I think it’s
been around the longest and it’s extremely configurable.  People who use
it swear it does everything they want but it takes a little work up
front to set it up.  I believe them.  And when you add inline text, you
do it in the page itself which is much more natural than typing into GoodReader’s
disembodied text box.</p>

<p>On the downside, it’s been crashy for me.  I’ve been using an original
iPad, so maybe it’s more stable on newer hardware.  It doesn’t have a
scroll bar that lets you move directly to the end (or beginning) of your
document.  It doesn’t always highlight the spaces between words and I
can’t get it to autocorrect when using the typewriter tool.  But even if
these things got fixed, I just find the ugly icons too distracting.</p>

<h2 id="pdf-expert-40"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-fill-forms-annotate/id393316844">PDF Expert 4.0</a></h2>

<p>Ah, we have a winner!  PDF Expert is a breath of fresh air.  It has
everything I like about GoodReader (except the back button) in a package
that’s just beautiful to look at.  The document management UI is
super-clean, fast, and intuitive.  It even gives you thumbnails of the
first page of each document.  The icons in the document annotation UI
are simple and classy.  When browsing a pdf, the page turns are very
fast.</p>

<p>On top of this, I don’t know how I lived without PDF Expert’s  undo and
redo commands.  They not only keep you from inadvertently junking up
your document, it means the UI doesn’t ever ask “Are you really
sure?” when you delete something because you can always roll back to the
previous state.  </p>

<p>What’s not to like?  Some people complain that it only opens one
document at a time, but I find opening and closing to be fast
enough that this isn’t a big deal.  My biggest complaint (and it’s
minor) is that you only have 9 colors to choose from for markup and
they’re kind of brash.  It’s like they were inspired by the available
colors for Apple’s <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/95875/which-smart-cover-to-get-get-a-polyurethane-one-heres-why/">cheap Smart Covers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">PDFpen</a> has been around for quite a while on the Mac, and if Preview
wasn’t as good as it was, I’d probably be using it there.  But on the
iPad, it’s the new kid on the block.  None of the positive reviews on
the app store compares it with the big three, and a few negative reviews
say it’s crashy and has fewer features.  It will probably improve over
time, but considering it costs the most ($15) and seemingly does the
least, I’m skipping it for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability-take-notes-annotate/id360593530">Notability</a> is really a note-taking app that can also annotate PDF’s.
When I’m in a meeting or seminar, I usually use Nebulous Notes and type
right into a text file.  If I have a copy of the slides or the paper
being presented, I now take my notes right on them with PDF Expert.
Notability is particularly strong with drawing, but I find even with my
Cosmonaut stylus, the lag between moving the pen and seeing my picture
is just too unnatural to replace pen and paper.  </p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>PDF Expert is fantastic.  I’m so glad I went through this exercise and
have graduated from GoodReader!  Of course, I could have just read Cynical
Babblings’ <a href="http://cynicalbabblings.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/pdf-editing-apps-2012-review/">recent review</a> of same apps.  I found it while I was
in the middle of my evaluation process, and he’s much more thorough than
I am.  And he also likes PDF Expert best.</p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/05/10/carle-vs-lioni</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most grown-ups, even those without kids, have heard of Eric Carle—He is
an extremely popular children’s book author who illustrates using
collage.  In fact, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Bear-What-You-See/dp/0805047905">Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do See</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Hungry-Caterpillar-Eric-Carle/dp/0399226907">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> have now supplanted Margaret Wise Brown’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0694003611">Goodnight Moon</a> as the standard gift for newborn kids.</p>

<p>Both my daughters celebrated Eric Carle week at school last month
and it got me thinking (again) just how over-rated he is.  He’s
either today’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> or the kids’ version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinkade">Thomas Kinkade</a>
(“Painter of Light”).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  With a few exceptions (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Birthday-Message-Board-Book/dp/0694011487">The Secret Birthday Message</a>), his books couldn’t be more repetitive and formulaic.</p>

<p>I’m not saying his books have no redeeming qualities—the pictures are
pretty and they do appeal to the 1-2 year old crowd. But thats not
exactly the most demanding audience and his collage style isn’t even
unique. Leo Lionni started publishing picture books with collage back in
1959 and Lois Ehlert won a Caldecott in 1989 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Color-Board-Book-Lois-Ehlert/dp/0694010677">Color Zoo</a>.</p>

<p>Leo Lionni in particular deserves far more attention than he gets. The
only good thing about many of his books being out of print is that it
made it slightly easier to pick four Lionni books to send to my sister’s
family for Christmas.</p>

<p>Lionni was a late bloomer as a children’s book author as he had a full
career as a “real” artist before writing
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Blue-Yellow-Leo-Lionni/dp/0688132855">Little Blue and Little Yellow</a>. His stories are quirky and many push
the envelope on what’s possible in a kids’ book.  And every one has a
positive message.  For example in his first book, the characters are
splotches of color who get mixed up and turn green.  Their parents don’t
recognize them until they cry themselves apart, but then the parents recognize
their mistake and learn not to be so judgmental.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flea-Story-Leo-Lionni/dp/0905478266">A Flea Story</a>, you never even see the main characters. Instead you
only hear a dialog that’s reminiscent of Herman Hesse’s odd couple
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Narcissus-Goldmund-Hermann-Hesse/dp/B003NQOS4M">Narcissus and Goldmund</a>. One flea just wants to stay home on their
dog’s butt while the other longs for adventure. They travel together for
a while and then split to follow their own paths. Stories that appeal to
both adults and children are rare and those that do usually have two
sets of jokes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a> is the classic example). Lionni
manages to make the same things funny to all ages.</p>

<p>One of R’s favorite Lioni stories is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matthews-Dream-Leo-Lionni/dp/067987318X">Matthew’s Dream</a>. Matthew is a poor
mouse who visits a museum with his school and is inspired to be an
artist. He dreams fantastic versions of his mundane world and paints
them into reality.  Often when R paints her own pictures she says “I’m
Matthew!”</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Wind-Up-Mouse-Leo-Lionni/dp/0394829115">Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</a>, Alexander yearns to be a windup
mouse who is loved by the family instead of hated and chased with a
broom. He finds a magical lizard who will grant him his wish in exchange
for a purple pebble.  By the time he acquires one, the world has changed
and he learns to be careful what he wishes for.  R still looks for
purple pebbles to give to the lizard.</p>

<p>My one year old does like flipping through Eric Carle board books, but
as soon as she will sit still and let us read to her, she’s graduating to
Leo Lionni. The pictures are even more beautiful, the stories are
awesome, and the whole family can enjoy the ride.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>My wife thinks it’s a cheap shot comparing Carle to Kinkade, but I
never miss a chance to bring up my favorite abusive alcoholic
religious nut-job artist, even if he did pass away recently.  And the
truth is, I think his work is pretty.  Just like Eric Carle’s.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/04/28/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-2/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://highvariance.net/blog/2012/04/28/kid-book-review-library-trip-report-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The main goal of our biweekly trip to the New Haven Free Public Library is to
pick 20 or so great picture books.  I’m looking for books with beautiful
art, lovable (or at least memorable) characters, an original story, and
a positive message.  These books are rare and they’re difficult to
identify by a book spine, a book cover, or even a quick perusal.  And I
don’t have time for much more than that.</p>

<p>So the failure rate is high, but in this case failing isn’t all that bad
an outcome.  In fact, most books that come home succeed on at least one
dimension.  Sometimes the books are so spectacularly awful or
inappropriate that they stretch your brain.  And often R’s favorite
books are not my favorites.  The bottom line is that we both get a fair
amount out of reading the mediocre bulk of our haul, even when most get
returned never to be read again.</p>

<p>Our latest keepers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Umbrella-Queen-Shirin-Bridges/dp/0060750405">The Umbrella Queen</a> (by Shirin Yim Bridges, illustrated by Taeeun
  Yoo) I have a special place in my heart for atypical stories
  that take place in other countries.  And even better, I
  like stories about kids who are true to themselves.  This book takes
  place in Thailand and follows a girl whose inner artist cannot
  be squashed.  It reminds me a lot of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Empty-Pot-Demi/dp/0805082271">The Empty Pot</a>(by
  Demi) and I Ioved
  that too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Library-Lion-Michelle-Knudsen/dp/076363784X">Library Lion</a> (by Michelle Knudsen, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes) The
  lesson here is fantastic: Rules are good, but there are always
  extenuating circumstances when they should be broken.  The premise is
  absurd (a friendly helpful lion hangs out at the library) but not
  totally drug-addled (see
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hogula-Dread-Night-Jean-Gralley/dp/0805071644/">Hogula: the Dread Pig of the Night</a> (by
  Jean Gralley) for an
  example of the latter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Worker-Kate-Banks/dp/0374400008">The Night Worker</a> (by Kate Banks, illustrated by Georg Hallensleben)
A respectful portrayal of a Latino engineer who takes a son to the job
site one night.  Lots of construction equipment and beautiful almost
Gauguin-style paintings.  What’s not to love?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Dragon-Kate-Banks/dp/B003IWYJIG">Max’s Dragon</a>by Kate Banks, illustrated by Boris Kulikov) This
story is about two (older?) brothers playing croquet and their quirky
(younger?) brother who has a big imagination and loves rhymes.
Super-cute and super-original and the art is good though not my
favorite style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polar-Bear-Easy---Read-Puffin/dp/0140386920">A Polar Bear Can Swim</a> (by Harriet Ziefert, illustrated by Emily
Bolam) This book is designed for kids who are learning to read on
their own and who are curious about animals and science.  That’s a
perfect match for R.  It’s filled with fun facts (“A cow can drink 75
gallons of water in a day!”) and simple artwork.  I’m excited to check out
other members of the Viking Science Easy-to-Read series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balloons-Dee-Lillegard/dp/0525459405">Balloons Balloons Balloons</a> (by Dee Lillegard, illustrated by
Bernadette Pons) I admit I find this book a little brain-numbing, but
R is going to love any book that has a rabbit in a hot air balloon
dumping huge numbers of multicolored balloons on a whole town.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-River-Marjorie-Kinnan-Rawlings/dp/1416911790">The Secret River</a> (by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, illustrated by Leo
and Diane Dillon) This book is special.  It was written in 1947 by the
author of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yearling-Aladdin-Classics-Marjorie-Rawlings/dp/0689846231">The Yearling</a>
and it follows a poor black girl who lives in the rural South in the
early part of the 20th century.  I don’t have a lot of experience with
this environment, but it sure seems real to me.  The art is great and
the story is magical in a way that works for adults and children.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Honorable mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ginger-Bear-Mini-Grey/dp/0375842535">Ginger Bear</a> (by Mini Grey) R and I both like the part where Horace
smears cookie dough all over the toilet seat, but it goes downhill
from there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Really-Rabbits-Virginia-L-Kroll/dp/157091897X">Really Rabbits</a> (by Virginia Kroll, illustrated by Philomena
O’Neill) Cute story about two pet rabbits who do household chores in
the middle of the night.  We could use these guys in our house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Classic-Read-Book/dp/0061885177">Wonder Woman: I am Wonder Woman</a> (by Eric K. Stein, illustrated by
Rick Farley) An adaptation of a comic book?  Really? Yes!  Wonder Woman is a
positive role model for girls and R loves her tiara and bracelets.
And it doesn’t hurt that Dad had a thing for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Carter#Wonder_Woman">Linda Carter</a>
when he was in high school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Tour-Jarrett-Krosoczka/dp/0375833439">Punk Farm On Tour</a> (by Jarrett J. Krosoczka) It’s really quite good,
but if you already have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punk-Farm-Jarrett-J-Krosoczka/dp/0440417937">Punk Farm</a> you’re not getting a whole lot
more here.  If you don’t have <em>Punk Farm</em> yet, you need to run out and
get it right away!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tricycle-Elisa-Amado/dp/0888996144">Tricycle</a> (by Elisa Amado, illustrated by Alfonso Ruano) A girl from
a wealthy family in Guatemala is friends with three poor kids next
door.  She sees them steal her tricycle but doesn’t say anything to
her parents because she knows she shouldn’t have left it in the bushes
and she already has a lot more stuff than they have.  I love the complex
emotions and the interplay of personal relationships and the gulf
between rich and poor that exists pretty much everywhere but is
especially stark in Latin America.  All of this is lost on R, but
she’s 3.  I’m not so sure she’ll get it at 5 either, but I commend the
authors for trying!</p>
